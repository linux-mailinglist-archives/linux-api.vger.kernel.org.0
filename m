After a little more digging, I found out why cpumask_local_spread change
affects the general/initial smp_affinity for certain device IRQs.

After the introduction of the commit:

    e2e64a932 genirq: Set initial affinity in irq_set_affinity_hint()

For all the drivers that set hint, initial affinity is set based on the
CPU retrieved from cpumask_local_spread. So in an environment where
irqbalance is disabled, these device IRQs remain on the CPUs that are
picked from cpumask_local_spread even though they are isolated. I think
the commit message of the reverted patch should have covered this as
well.
