I'm glad we agree. :)

John, when you're back from vacation, can we get rid of this language
and all those checks under _is_dsync() in the iomap patch?

(That code is 100% the result of me handwaving and bellyaching 6 months
ago when the team was trying to get all the atomic writes bits working
prior to LSF and I was too burned out to think the xfs part through.
As a result, I decided that we'd only support strict overwrites for the
first iteration.)

Perhaps this ^^ is what we should be documenting here.
