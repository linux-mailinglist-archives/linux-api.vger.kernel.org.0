No, it doesn't. I'm trying to understand what you are suggesting though.
Are you saying !task || tas->exit_state is enough and we shouldn't use
the helper that was added in commit 38fd525a4c61 ("exit: Factor
thread_group_exited out of pidfd_poll"). If so what does that buy us
open-coding the check instead of using that helper? Is there an actual
bug here?

Sorry, I just have a hard time understanding what you wanted then. :)

"I guess it is too late to change this behavior." made it sound like a)
there's a problem and b) that you would prefer to change behavior. Thus,
it seems that wait(WNOHANG) hanging when a traced leader of an empty
thread-group has exited is a problem in your eyes.

Ok, that's good then. I would expect that at least stuff like rr makes
use of pidfd and they might rely on this behavior - although I haven't
checked their code.

Yeah, I got that but it would still be useful to understand the wider
context you were adressing.

Yeah, I missed the PIDFD_THREAD flag suggestion. Sorry about that. Btw,
I'm not sure whether you remember that but when we originally did the
pidfd work you and I discussed thread support and already decided back
then that having a flag like PIDFD_THREAD would likely be the way to go.

The PIDFD_THREAD flag would be would be interesting because we could
make pidfd_send_signal() support this flag as well to allow sending a
signal to a specific thread. That's something that I had also wanted to
support. And I've been asked for this a few times already. What do you
think?
