commands. We will publish it once you confirm.

&gt; Thank you for kicking off this discussion, Jonathan.<br>
<br>
Hi Sreenivas,<br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; We need guidance from the community.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 1. Datacenter customers must be able to manage PCIe switches in-band.<=
br>
<br>
What is the use case? My understanding so far is that clouds and<br>
similar sometimes use an in band path but it would be from a management<br>
only host, not a general purpose host running other software. Sure<br>
that control host just connects to a different upstream port so, from<br>
a switch point of view, it&#39;s the same as any other host.=C2=A0 From a h=
ost<br>
software point of view it&#39;s not running general cloud workloads or<br>
(at least in most cases) a general purpose OS distribution.<br>
<br>
This is the key question behind this discussion.<br>
<br>
&gt; 2. Management of switches includes getting health, performance, and er=
ror<br>
&gt; telemetry.<br>
<br>
For telemetry(subject to any odd corners like commands that might lock<br>
the interface up for a long time, which we&#39;ve seen with commands in the=
<br>
Spec!) I don&#39;t see any problem supporting those on all host software.<b=
r>
They should be non destructive to other hosts etc.<br>
<br>
&gt; 3. These telemetry functions are not yet part of the CXL standard<br>
<br>
Ok, so this we should try to pin down the boundaries around this.<br>
The thread linked below lays out the reasoning behind a general rule<br>
of not accepting vendor defined commands, but perhaps there are routes<br>
to answer some of those concerns.<br>
<br>
&#39;Maybe&#39; if you were to publish a specification for those particular=
<br>
vendor defined commands, it might be fine to add them to the allow list<br>
for the switch-cci. Key here is that Broadcom would be committing to not<br=
>
using those particular opcodes from the vendor space for anything else<br>
in the future (so we could match on VID + opcode).=C2=A0 This is similar to=
<br>
some DVSEC usage in PCIe (and why DVSEC is different from VSEC).<br>
<br>
Effectively you&#39;d be publishing an additional specification building on=
 CXL.<br>
Those are expected to surface anyway from various standards orgs - should<b=
r>
we treat a company published one differently?=C2=A0 I don&#39;t see why.<br=
>
Exactly how this would work might take some figuring out (in main code,<br>
separate driver module etc?)<br>
<br>
That specification would be expected to provide a similar level of detail<b=
r>
to CXL spec defined commands (ideally the less vague ones, but meh, up to<b=
r>
you as long as any side effects are clearly documented!)<br>
<br>
Speaking for myself, I&#39;d consider this approach.<br>
Particularly true if I see clear effort in the standards org to push<br>
these into future specifications as that shows broadcom are trying to<br>
enhance the ecosystems.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; 4. We built the CCI mailboxes into our PCIe switches per CXL spec and<=
br>
&gt; developed our management scheme around them.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; If the Linux community does not allow a CXL spec-compliant switch to b=
e<br>
&gt; managed via the CXL spec-defined CCI mailbox, then please guide us on<=
br>
&gt; the right approach. Please tell us how you propose we manage our switc=
hes<br>
&gt; in-band.<br>
<br>
The Linux community is fine supporting this in the kernel (the BMC or<br>
Fabric Management only host case - option 2 below, so the code will be ther=
e)<br>
the question here is what advice we offer to the general purpose<br>
distributions and what protections we need to put in place to mitigate the<=
br>
&#39;blast radius&#39; concerns.<br>
<br>
Jonathan<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Thank you<br>

&gt; &gt; Hi All,<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; This is has come up in a number of discussions both on list and i=
n private,<br>
&gt; &gt; so I wanted to lay out a potential set of rules when deciding whe=
ther or<br>
&gt; &gt; not<br>
&gt; &gt; to provide a user space interface for a particular feature of CXL=
 Fabric<br>
&gt; &gt; Management.=C2=A0 The intent is to drive discussion, not to simpl=
y tell people<br>
&gt; &gt; a set of rules.=C2=A0 I&#39;ve brought this to the public lists a=
s it&#39;s a Linux<br>
&gt; &gt; kernel<br>
&gt; &gt; policy discussion, not a standards one.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Whilst I&#39;m writing the RFC this my attempt to summarize a pos=
sible<br>
&gt; &gt; position rather than necessarily being my personal view.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; It&#39;s a straw man - shoot at it!<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Not everyone in this discussion is familiar with relevant kernel =
or CXL<br>
&gt; &gt; concepts<br>
&gt; &gt; so I&#39;ve provided more info than I normally would.<br>

&gt; &gt; CXL has two different types of Fabric. The comments here refer to=
 both, but<br>
&gt; &gt; for now the kernel stack is focused on the simpler VCS fabric, no=

&gt; &gt; Some typical fabric management activities:<br>
&gt; &gt; 1) Bind/Unbind vPPB to physical DSP (Results in hotplug / unplug =
events)<br>
&gt; &gt; 2) Access config space or BAR space of End Points below the switc=
h.<br>
&gt; &gt; 3) Tunneling messages through to devices downstream (e.g Dynamic =
Capacity<br>
&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 Forced Remove that will blow away some memory even i=
f a host is using<br>
&gt; &gt; it).<br>
&gt; &gt; 4) Non destructive stuff like status read back.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Given the hosts may be using the Type 3 hosted memory (either Sin=
gle<br>
&gt; &gt; Logical<br>
&gt; &gt; Device - SLD, or an LD on a Multi logical Device - MLD) as normal=
 memory,<br>
&gt; &gt; unbinding a device in use can result in the memory access from a<=

ps a rack of<br>
&gt; &gt; servers.=C2=A0 This discussion applies equally to FM-API commands=
 sent to Multi<br>
&gt; &gt; Head Devices (see CXL r3.1).<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; The Fabric Management actions are done using the CXL spec defined=
 Fabric<br>
&gt; &gt; Management API, (FM-API) which is transported over various means =
including<br>
&gt; &gt; OoB MCTP over your favourite transport (I2C, PCIe-VDM...) or via =
normal<br>
&gt; &gt; PCIe read/write to a Switch-CCI.=C2=A0 A Switch-CCI is mailbox in=
 PCI BAR<br>
&gt; &gt; space on a function found alongside one of the switch upstream po=
rts;<br>
&gt; &gt; this mailbox is very similar to the MMPT definition found in PCIe=
 r6.2.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; In many cases this switch CCI / MCTP connection is used by a BMC =
rather<br>
&gt; &gt; than a normal host, but there have been some questions raised abo=
ut whether<br>
&gt; &gt; a general purpose server OS would have a valid reason to use this=
 interface<br>
&gt; &gt; (beyond debug and testing) to configure the switch or an MHD.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; If people have a use case for this, please reply to this thread t=
o give<br>
&gt; &gt; more details.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; The most recently posted CXL Switch-CCI support only provided the=
 RAW CXL<br>
&gt; &gt; command IOCTL interface that is already available for Type 3 memo=
ry<br>
&gt; &gt; devices.<br>
&gt; &gt; That allows for unfettered control of the switch but, because it =
is<br>
&gt; &gt; extremely easy to shoot yourself in the foot and cause unsolvable=
 bug<br>
&gt; &gt; reports,<br>
&gt; &gt; it taints the kernel. There have been several requests to provide=
 this<br>
&gt; &gt; interface<br>
&gt; &gt; without the taint for these switch configuration mailboxes.<br>

&gt; &gt; Note there are unrelated reasons why that code hasn&#39;t been up=
dated since<br>
&gt; &gt; v6.6 time,<br>
&gt; &gt; but I am planning to get back to it shortly.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Similar issues will occur for other uses of PCIe MMPT (new mailbo=
x in PCI<br>
&gt; &gt; that<br>
&gt; &gt; sometimes is used for similarly destructive activity such as PLDM=
 based<br>
&gt; &gt; firmware update).<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; On to the proposed rules:<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; 1) Kernel space use of the various mailboxes, or filtered control=
s from<br>
&gt; &gt; user space.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Absolutely fine - no one worries about this, but the mediated tra=
ffic will<br>
&gt; &gt; be filtered for potentially destructive side effects. E.g. it wil=
l reject<br>
&gt; &gt; attempts to change anything routing related if the kernel either =
knows a<br>
&gt; &gt; host is<br>
&gt; &gt; using memory that will be blown away, or has no way to know (so a=
ffecting<br>
&gt; &gt; routing to another host).=C2=A0 This includes blocking &#39;all&#=
39; vendor defined<br>
&gt; &gt; messages as we have no idea what the do.=C2=A0 Note this means th=
e kernel has<br>
&gt; &gt; an allow list and new commands are not initially allowed.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; This isn&#39;t currently enabled for Switch CCIs because they are=
 only really<br>
&gt; &gt; interesting if the potentially destructive stuff is available (an=
 earlier<br>
&gt; &gt; version did enable query commands, but it wasn&#39;t particularly=
 useful to<br>
&gt; &gt; know what your switch could do but not be allowed to do any of it=
).<br>
&gt; &gt; If you take a MMPT usecase of PLDM firmware update, the filtering=
 would<br>
&gt; &gt; check that the device was in a state where a firmware update won&=
#39;t rip<br>
&gt; &gt; memory out from under a host, which would be messy if that host i=
s<br>
&gt; &gt; doing the update.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; 2) Unfiltered userspace use of mailbox for Fabric Management - BM=
C kernels<br>
&gt; &gt; =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

=3D=3D=3D<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; (This would just be a kernel option that we&#39;d advise normal s=
erver<br>
&gt; &gt; distributions not to turn on. Would be enabled by openBMC etc)<br=
>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; This is fine - there is some work to do, but the switch-cci PCI d=
river<br>
&gt; &gt; will hopefully be ready for upstream merge soon. There is no filt=
ering of<br>
&gt; &gt; accesses. Think of this as similar to all the damage you can do v=
ia<br>
&gt; &gt; MCTP from a BMC. Similarly it is likely that much of the complexi=
ty<br>
&gt; &gt; of the actual commands will be left to user space tooling:<br>
&gt; &gt; <a href=3D"https://gitlab.com/jic23/cxl-fmapi-tests" rel=3D"noref=
errer" target=3D"_blank">https://gitlab.com/jic23/cxl-fmapi-tests</a> has s=
ome test examples.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Whether Kconfig help text is strong enough to ensure this only ge=
ts<br>
&gt; &gt; enabled for BMC targeted distros is an open question we can addre=
ss<br>
&gt; &gt; alongside an updated patch set.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; (On to the one that the &quot;debate&quot; is about)<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; 3) Unfiltered user space use of mailbox for Fabric Management - D=
istro<br>
&gt; &gt; kernels<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D<br>
&gt; &gt; (General purpose Linux Server Distro (Redhat, Suse etc))<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; This is equivalent of RAW command support on CXL Type 3 memory de=
vices.<br>
&gt; &gt; You can enable those in a distro kernel build despite the scary c=
onfig<br>
&gt; &gt; help text, but if you use it the kernel is tainted. The result<br=
>
&gt; &gt; of the taint is to add a flag to bug reports and print a big mess=
age to say<br>
&gt; &gt; that you&#39;ve used a feature that might result in you shooting =
yourself<br>
&gt; &gt; in the foot.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; The taint is there because software is not at first written to de=
al with<br>
&gt; &gt; everything that can happen smoothly (e.g. surprise removal) It&#3=
9;s hard<br>
&gt; &gt; to survive some of these events, so is never on the initial featu=
re list<br>
&gt; &gt; for any bus, so this flag is just to indicate we have entered a w=
orld<br>
&gt; &gt; where almost all bets are off wrt to stability.=C2=A0 We might no=
t know what<br>
&gt; &gt; a command does so we can&#39;t assess the impact (and no one trus=
ts vendor<br>
&gt; &gt; commands to report affects right in the Command Effects Log - whi=
ch<br>
&gt; &gt; in theory tells you if a command can result problems).<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; A concern was raised about GAE/FAST/LDST tables for CXL Fabrics<b=
r>
&gt; &gt; (a r3.1 feature) but, as I understand it, these are intended for =
a<br>
&gt; &gt; host to configure and should not have side effects on other hosts=
?<br>
&gt; &gt; My working assumption is that the kernel driver stack will handle=
<br>
&gt; &gt; these (once we catch up with the current feature backlog!) Curren=
tly<br>
&gt; &gt; we have no visibility of what the OS driver stack for a fabrics w=
ill<br>
&gt; &gt; actually look like - the spec is just the starting point for that=
.<br>
&gt; &gt; (patches welcome ;)<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; The various CXL upstream developers and maintainers may have<br>
&gt; &gt; differing views of course, but my current understanding is we wan=
t<br>
&gt; &gt; to support 1 and 2, but are very resistant to 3!<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>

&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; One side aspect of why we really don&#39;t like unfiltered usersp=
ace access to<br>
&gt; &gt; any<br>
&gt; &gt; of these devices is that people start building non standard hacks=
 in and we<br>
&gt; &gt; lose the ecosystem advantages. Forcing a considered discussion + =
patches<br>
&gt; &gt; to let a particular command be supported, drives standardization.=

&gt; &gt; provides some history on vendor specific extensions and why in ge=
neral we<br>
&gt; &gt; won&#39;t support them upstream.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; To address another question raised in an earlier discussion:<br>
&gt; &gt; Putting these Fabric Management interfaces behind guard rails of =
some type<br>
&gt; &gt; (e.g. CONFIG_IM_A_BMC_AND_CAN_MAKE_A_MESS) does not encourage the=
 risk<br>
&gt; &gt; of non standard interfaces, because we will be even less likely t=
o accept<br>
&gt; &gt; those upstream!<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; If anyone needs more details on any aspect of this please ask.<br=
>
&gt; &gt; There are a lot of things involved and I&#39;ve only tried to giv=
e a fairly<br>
&gt; &gt; minimal illustration to drive the discussion. I may well have mis=
sed<br>
&gt; &gt; something crucial.<br>
