My background is in kernel testing I do maintain the Linux Test Project
for more than a decade now. During the years we did create many "unit
tests" for kernel syscalls that are watching over the syscall API and
making sure that we get right results for both valid and invalid inputs.
These tests can also be considered to be a form of a documentation. The
same goes for some of the selftests that have been added to kernel repo
in the recent years. In a sense these are the most detailed descriptions
of the interfaces we have.

The main problem is that the kernel userspace boundary is large, we have
thousands of tests and I'm pretty sure that we don't cover even half of
it.

Also some of the interfaces are too complex to be even described in any
formal system, mostly the modern stuff such as io_uring or bfp. I have
had hard time even understading how to use these and I doubt I would be
even able to build a formal system to describe them. Especially since
the io_uring is mostly syscall less and we talk to the kernel by shared
buffers and atomic data updates.

Having this would be awesome, this is just one step from actually
generating automated tests for the syscalls. However my estimate is that
even if you started to work on this now it will take decade to get
somewhere, but maybe I'm too pesimistic.

Stil fingers crossed.
