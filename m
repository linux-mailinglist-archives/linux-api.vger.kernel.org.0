There is somewhere a sysctl that provides information needed for the
emulation.  Base addresses or something like that.  I have only seen it
mentioned briefly.  This was one of the uses of sys_sysctl that
was mentioned in the first conversation about removing it.

The information should still be exported through /proc/sys/

Greg I will agree with you that whatever userspace is doing it should get
the information in a modern way that supports multiple busses or
at a bare minimum userspace should read the values it needs from
the files under /proc/sys.

I do sympathize as this appears to be a regression.  Even if not all of
the code was merged.

The use case is one I am familiar with bring up code wanting easy access
from userspace so people can experiment and figure out what is really
going on with the hardware.

Luis please see if you can use the interfaces that support multiple
busses.  That should be more robust in the future.  Especially if you
are bit-banging to load firmware or other userspace drivers, the is a
reasonable chance your hardware will appear on a system with multiple
busses someday and will actually need that support.

Eric
