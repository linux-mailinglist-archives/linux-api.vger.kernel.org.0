True, if someone calls from a racy context then there's not much we can 
do to ensure that any CPU *remains* online after we initially observed 
it to be, but when it's called from somewhere safe like a cpuhp offline 
handler, then picking from cpu_online_mask *did* always do the right 
thing (by my interpretation), whereas picking from 
housekeeping_cpumask() might not.

This is why I decided to ask rather than just send a patch to fix what I 
think might be a bug - I have no objection if this *is* intended 
behaviour, other than suggesting we amend the "...selects an online 
CPU..." comment if that aspect was never meant to be relied upon.

Thanks,
Robin.
