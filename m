The problem is that new programs will have to try the new flag value
and, if it returns -EINVAL, fall back to 0.  This isn't so great.

Wait, are you suggesting that 0 means invoke jitter-entropy or
whatever and GRND_SECURE_BLOCKING means not wait forever and deadlock?
 That's no good -- people will want to continue using 0 because the
behavior is better. My point here is that asking for secure random
numbers isn=E2=80=99t some legacy oddity =E2=80=94 it=E2=80=99s genuinely n=
ecessary. The
kernel should do whatever it needs to in order to make it work.  We
really don=E2=80=99t want a situation where 0 means get me secure random
numbers reliably but spam the logs and GRND_SECURE_BLOCKING means
don=E2=80=99t spam the logs but risk deadlocking. This will encourage peopl=
e
to pass 0 to get the improved behavior.

IMO this is confusing.  The GRND_RANDOM flag was IMO a mistake and
should just be retired.  Let's enumerate useful cases and then give
them sane values.

I think this is the complete list of "good" behaviors for new programs:

"insecure": always works, never warns.

"secure, blocking": always returns *eventually* with secure output,
i.e., does something to avoid deadlocks

"secure, nonblocking" returns secure output immediately or returns -EAGAIN.

And the only real question is how to map existing users to these
semantics.  I see two sensible choices:

1. 0 means "secure, blocking". I think this is not what we'd do if we
could go back in time and chage the ABI from day 1, but I think it's
actually good enough.  As long as this mode won't deadlock, it's not
*that* bad if programs are using it when they wanted "insecure".

2. 0 means "secure, blocking, but warn".  Some new value means
"secure, blocking, don't warn".  The problem is that new applications
will have to fall back to 0 to continue supporting old kernels.

I briefly thought that maybe GRND_RANDOM would be a reasonable choice
for "secure, blocking, don't warn", but the effect on new programs on
old kernels will be unfortunate.

I'm willing to go along with #2 if you like it better than #1, and
I'll update my patches accordingly, but I prefer #1.

I do think we should make all the ABI changes that we want to make all
in one release.  Let's not make programs think about their behavior on
more versions than necessary.  So I'd like to get rid of the current
/dev/random semantics, add "insecure" mode, and do whatever deadlock
avoidance scheme we settle on in a single release.
