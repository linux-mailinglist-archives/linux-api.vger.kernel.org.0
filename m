Its easier to specify "all members of set" rather than having to specify each
individual member. Thinking of set as a description of types of
activities that should not have a given CPU as a target.

Your point makes sense, but the "isolated CPU + one interrupt to this CPU"
use-case is a valid one.

"target CPU" is the CPU we are interested in executing the application
(and handling the interrupt). So isolation happens today in the
following components:

        1)  setup kernel boot parameters for isolation (suppose
            the goal is to move these to happen dynamically in
            userspace, so they would move to step 2 in the future).

        2)  disable certain activities from happening at target CPU: "exclude ALL
            activities for target CPU which can be performed by
            housekeeping CPUs" (which might involve a
            number of steps in userspace such as
            the RPS mask configuration, network queue configuration
            to avoid vector exhaustion, removal of other activities
            on target CPU).

        3) userspace informs status of execution of isolated
           application (via the prctl interface, the QUIESCE step).
           From this point on interruptions (not as in IRQs but as in
	   "isolation breaking events") should be either ignored
           or logged.

Well i think any activity which can possibly cause an interruption
should be blocked from happening in the kernel. Which can be done as
soon as the

        "if (cpu_is_isolated(cpu))"

Logic can be integrated.

Yes, and today the isolation is being performed:

1) At boot time.
2) At isolation configuration (userspace). We have been trying to
centralize this in tuned profiles:

* With isolcpus=domain,: https://github.com/redhat-performance/tuned/blob/master/profiles/realtime-virtual-host/realtime-virtual-host-variables.conf
* With cgroups sets / systemd affinity masks: https://github.com/redhat-performance/tuned/blob/master/profiles/cpu-partitioning/tuned.conf

We discussed separating housekeeping_mask in per feature masks here:

https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/9/3/1067

So that userspace could control each feature individually.

Good point.

-> Isolate CPU event: steps 1 and 2 above.
-> Unisolate CPU event: undo steps 1 and 2 above (considering the
boot-time limitation of 1).

-> Network device creation: Currently the proposed solution seems to be 
https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/1/22/815, which requires userspace
code modification (still missing this case).

-> CPU hotplug/hotunplug: unclear.

Agree. CPU hotplug for example is not a feature which is very common 
on this type of deployments. Having an initial implementation 
which is suitable for the use cases in production seems OK.

Agree: the dynamic handling can be done as a later step.

Not sure i get this.

The usecase here seems to be hardware with a single OS running both
isolated and non-isolated workloads (say a latency sensitive
application, using multiple cores, and it can scale up/down on 
the number of cores depending on load). On the remaining CPUs 
one can use non-latency sensitive workloads.

Does that make sense?

Fail to parse sentence. Can you expand on "CPUs that are available for
various things?"

Hum, not sure why, have you read the discussion mentioned above, about 
the sysfs interface to control housekeeping?

> Maybe it's a bad idea to have only one kind of "housekeeping". 

Yes! That seems to be the same conclusion on the thread.

Forgot to CC you here:
https://www.spinics.net/lists/kernel/msg3814616.html

Can probably drop patch 7/9 from your series once this is
integrated.
