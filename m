The original issue as seen, was that if you rmmod/insmod a driver
*without* irqbalance running, the default irq mask is -1, which means
any CPU. The older kernels (this issue was patched in 2014) used to use
that affinity mask, but the value programmed into all the interrupt
registers "actual affinity" would end up delivering all interrupts to
CPU0, and if the machine was under traffic load incoming when the
driver loaded, CPU0 would start to poll among all the different netdev
queues, all on CPU0.

The above then leads to the condition that the device is stuck polling
even if the affinity gets updated from user space, and the polling will
continue until traffic stops.

Maybe the right thing is to fix which CPUs are passed in as the valid
mask, or make sure the kernel cross checks that what the driver asks
for is a "valid CPU"?
