I'm not sure what you mean by in band.  Aim here was to discuss
in-band drivers for switch CCI etc. Same reason from a kernel point of
view for why we include embedded drivers.  I'll interpret in band
as host driven and not inband as FM-API stuff.

If I read this right, I disagree with the 'only so far' bit.

In all substantial ways we should support BMC use case of the Linux Kernel
at a similar level to how we support forms of Linux Distros.  It may
not be our target market as developers for particular parts of our companie=
s,
but we should not block those who want to support it.

We should support them in drivers/ - maybe with example userspace code
in tools.  Linux distros on BMCs is a big market, there are a number
of different distros using (and in some cases contributing to) the
upstream kernel. Not everyone is using openBMC so there is not one
common place where downstream patches could be carried.
=46rom a personal point of view, I like that for the same reasons that
I like there being multiple Linux sever focused distros. It's a sign
of a healthy ecosystem to have diverse options taking the mainline
kernel as their starting point.

BMCs are just another embedded market, and like other embedded markets
we want to encourage upstream first etc.=20
openBMC has a policy on this:
https://github.com/openbmc/docs/blob/master/kernel-development.md
"The OpenBMC project maintains a kernel tree for use by the project.
The tree's general development policy is that code must be upstream
first." There are paths to bypass that for openBMC so it's a little
more relaxed than some enterprise distros (today, their policies used
to look very similar to this) but we should not be telling
them they need to carry support downstream.  If we are
going to tell them that, we need to be able to point at a major
sticking point for maintenance burden.  So far I don't see the
additional complexity as remotely close reaching that bar.

So I think we do want switch-cci support and for that matter the equivalent
for MHDs in the upstream kernel.

One place I think there is some wiggle room is the taint on use of raw
commands.  Leaving removal of that for BMC kernels as a patch they need
to carry downstream doesn't seem too burdensome. I'm sure they'll push
back if it is a problem for them!  So I think we can kick that question
into the future.

Addressing maintenance burden, there is a question of where we split
the stack.  Ignore MHDs for now (I won't go into why in this forum...)

The current proposal is (simplified to ignore some sharing in lookup code e=
tc
that I can rip out if we think it might be a long term problem)

              in essence it deals with the extra layer on top of the raw MM=

MMPT Mbox: Mailbox as per the PCI spec.
RAS API:   Shared RAS API specific infrastructure used by other drivers.

If we see a significant maintenance burden, maybe we duplicate the CXL spec=

to the Switch CCI.  There will be some duplication of logic however such
as background command support (which is CXL only IIUC)  We can even use
a difference IOCTL number so the two can diverge if needed in the long run.

e.g. If it makes it easier to get upstream, we can merrily duplicated code
so that only the bit common with RAS API etc is shared (assuming the
actually end up with MMPT, not the CXL mailbox which is what their current
publicly available spec talks about and I assume is a pref MMPT left over?)

If we end up with top architecture of the diagrams above, 2 will look pretty
similar to last version of the switch-cci patches.  So raw commands only + =
taint.
Factoring out MMPT is another layer that doesn't make that much difference =
in
practice to this discussion. Good to have, but the reuse here would be one =
layer
above that.

Or we just say go for second proposed architecture and 0 impact on the
CXL specific code, just reuse of the MMPT layer.  I'd imagine people will g=
et
grumpy on code duplication (and we'll spend years rejecting patch sets that
try to share the cdoe) but there should be no maintenance burden as
a result.
