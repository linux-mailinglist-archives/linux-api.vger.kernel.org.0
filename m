Thank you for providing insights into the Go use cases with MADV_HUGEPAGE
and the configuration options for defrag mode.

Considering the limitations with the "defer" mode, it becomes apparent
that there
is a gap in addressing scenarios where an application desires a lighter-wei=
ght
alternative to MADV_HUGEPAGE.

MADV_F_COLLAPSE_LIGHT aims to fill this gap by providing a more flexible an=
d
opportunistic approach, catering to applications in latency-sensitive
environments
that seek performance improvements with huge pages but prefer to avoid dire=
ct
reclaim and compaction. This option can serve as a valuable addition for us=
ers
who want more control over the behavior without the constraints of existing
configurations.

In the era of cloud-native computing, it's challenging for users to be
aware of the
THP configurations on all nodes in a cluster, let alone have
fine-grained control
over them. Simply disabling the use of huge pages due to concerns
about potential
direct reclamation and compaction may be regrettable, as users are deprived=
 of
the opportunity to experiment with large page allocations. However,
relying solely on
MADV_HUGEPAGE introduces the risk of unpredictable stalls, making it a trad=
e-off
that users must carefully consider.

By introducing MADV_F_COLLAPSE_LIGHT, we offer users a more flexible and
controllable solution in cloud-native environments, allowing them to
better balance
performance requirements and resource management. This selectively lightwei=
ght
alternative is designed to provide users with more choices to better
meet the diverse
needs of different scenarios.

Thanks again for your review and your suggestion!
