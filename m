Yeah, the guest IOPF(L1) handling may include the host-guest IOASID translation,
which can be placed in the IOASID layer (in fact it can be placed in many places
such as the vfio pci driver since it don't really handle the fault event, it just
transfers the event to the vIOMMU).
But the host IOPF(L2) has no relationship with IOASID at all, it needs to have a
knowledge of the vfio_dma ranges.
Could we add the host IOPF support to type1 first (integrate it within the MAP ioctl)?
And we may migrate the generic iommu controls (such as MAP/UNMAP...) from type1 to
IOASID in the future (it seems to be a huge work, I will be very happy if I could
help this)... :-)

Make sense.

It seems that we should additionally iommu_map the pages which are IOPF
enabled and pinned in vfio_iommu_type1_pin_pages, and there is no need
to add more tracking structures in Patch 7...

Make sense.

density? Did you mean the proportion of the IOPF enabled mappings?

Yeah, these are what we have to consider and test later. :-)
And the slope, plateau, and inflection point of the aggregate throughput
may depend on the specific device driver's behavior (such as whether they
reuse the DMA buffer)...
