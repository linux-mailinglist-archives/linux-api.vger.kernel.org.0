If the system call returning LSM ID value for SELinux but does not tell
the caller of that system call whether a specific action might be permitted,
what information does LSM ID value tell?

The patch description lacks relationship between LSM ID value and data.
In other words, why LSM ID values are needed (and are useful for doing what).
If the only information the caller can know from the LSM ID value were
what LSMs are enabled (i.e. the content of /sys/kernel/security/lsm ), why
bother to use LSM ID values? (Yes, integer comparison is faster than string
comparison. But that is not enough justification for not allowing out-of-tree
LSMs and eBPF-based access control mechanisms to have stable LSM ID values.)

What does "choosing an output format", "determining required privilege",
"bypassing security module specific behavior" mean? How can they choose
meaningful output format, determine appropriate privilege, bypass security
module specific behavior (if the only information the caller can know from
the LSM ID value were what LSMs are enabled) ?

My understanding is that "BPF is not an LSM module but infrastructure for using
LSM hooks".

Say, an access control implementation consists of two parts; "code" and "data".
The "code" is written by developers and is determined at compile time and is
interpreted by CPU, and the "data" is written by administrators and is interpreted
by "code". The "data" part can be either built-in (determined at compile time) or
loadable (configurable at run-time).

eBPF-based access control implementations (which can be loaded via bpf() system
call after boot) consists of "code" and "data". BPF will remain no-op unless
eBPF-based access control implementations are loaded via bpf() system call.
Thus, I believe that an eBPF-based access control implementation should be
considered as an LSM module (like SELinux etc.)
