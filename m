That’s our old friend TLS1.1 in CBC mode, which needs a random 
explicit IV for every record sent. Speed is still a reason at the 
margins in cases like that, but getrandom() is really fast. A stickier 
problem is that getrandom() is not certified for use with every 
compliance standard, and those often dictate precise use of some NIST 
DRBG or NRBG construction. That keeps people proliferating user-space 
RNGs even when speed isn’t as important.

+1 to this, and I’d add that anyone making VM snapshots that they plan 
to restore from multiple times really needs to think this through top to 
bottom. The system would likely need to be put in to some kind of 
quiescent state when the snapshot is taken.

A library like OpenSSL or BoringSSL also has to account for running 
inside a chroot, which also makes this hard.

I still like 4c, and as a user-space crypto-person, and a VM person, 
they have a lot of appeal. Alex and Adrian’s replies get into some of 
the sufficiency challenge. But for user-space libraries like the *SSLs, 
the JVMs, and other runtimes where RNGs show up, it could plug in easily 
enough.
