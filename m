I think one aspect leading to our misunderstanding here is the distinction
between the size of the rseq area _allocation_, and the offset after the la=
st
field supported by the given kernel.

With this in mind, let's state a bit more clearly our expected aux. vector
extensibility scheme.

With CONFIG_RSEQ=3Dy, the kernel would pass the following information throu=
gh
the ELF auxv:

- rseq allocation size (auxv_rseq_alloc_size),
- rseq allocation alignment (auxv_rseq_alloc_align),
- offset after the end of the last rseq field supported by this kernel (aux=
v_rseq_offset_end),

We always have auxv_rseq_alloc_size >=3D auxv_rseq_offset_end.

I would expect libc to use this information to allocate a memory area
at least auxv_rseq_alloc_size in size, with an alignment respecting
auxv_rseq_alloc_align. It would use a value >=3D auvx_rseq_alloc_size
as rseq_len argument for the rseq registration.

But I would expect libc to use the auxv_rseq_offset_end value to populate _=
_rseq_size,
so rseq users can rely on this to check whether the fields they are trying =
to access
is indeed populated by the kernel.

Of course, the kernel would still allow the original 32-byte rseq_len argum=
ent
for the rseq registration, so the original ABI still works. It would howeve=
r
reject any rseq registration with size smaller than auxv_rseq_alloc_size (o=
ther
than the 32-byte special-case).

Is that in line with what you have in mind ? Do we really need to expose th=
ose 3
auxv variables independently or can we somehow remove auxv_rseq_alloc_size =
and
use auxv_rseq_offset_end as a min value for allocation instead ?

Thanks,

Mathieu
