Thanks a lot for the patient explanation. : )

Actually this patch only adds a new file to existing fme platform driver, fme
platform driver already has several different types userspace interfaces,
including hwmon, sysfs and etc, so the new perf api is only one of them, as
we can't move the whole fme platform driver into drivers/perf/, we feel that
maybe we should keep that code together with other fme files in drivers/fpga/.

Thanks
