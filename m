So hooking init_module() is at the wrong layer -- for that to work, the container's /sbin/modprobe needs to already have figured out that the desired module is wireguard and have a .ko for it.

I just meant that the programs in the container can see the modules
available on the host. Simplest thing could be bind-mounting in the
host's module folder with suitable protection (locked read-only mount).
But yeah, it can likely be as simple as allowing it to ask for a module
and not bother telling it about what is available.
