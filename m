Hello! Dear

May the peace and love of the Almighty God be with you and your family!

Greeting in the name of the almighty God i wish you and your family
happy  moments of life now and forever more amen, my name is
Mrs.samera ali ,i am
59 years old from United State, I know that this will sound so
strange to  you, as we did not know or seen each other before,  but
sometimes understanding and trust matters, been related or known does
not  grant any assurance or trust, even someone unknowing may create
act of  trust even  than someone we know very well, therefore never
you have such  thoughts in  your mind, even if I don=E2=80=99t know you or =
we
never seen or know  each other  before, but God knows us and he has a
reason and a great  purpose of  directing this message to you, Please
because of my present  predicament and  circumstances i wish to
contact  you. I have been   suffering from cancer and have a short
life to live. i have made up my  mind to donate this my  inheritance
=E2=82=AC15.5Million Euro to the less  privileged, Orphanage home, those
affected by Coronavirus for their  medical support and treatment,
Therefore  for your support and efforts to  fulfill this mission, 40%
of this fund will  be for you, this means that  upon your receipt of
this fund you withdraw  this 40% immediately for your  own personal
use and compensation of your  efforts. The rest 60% you use it to
support the above mentioned organizations as our agreement.

Please help me to fulfill this my last wish,

I wait to hear from you again for further information if possible

Please reply me through this my private email address bellow for security r=

Thanks
Mrs.samera ali
