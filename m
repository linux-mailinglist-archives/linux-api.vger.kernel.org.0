Of course, looking at it from a kernel maintainer's perspective, it wouldn'=
t=20
be insane to do this anyway. If we at some point do start to care about cro=
ss-
process isolation in this way, or if another NT emulator wants to use this=
=20
interface and does care about cross-process isolation, it'll be necessary. =
At=20
least it'd make sense to make them separate files even if we don't implemen=
t=20
granular permission handling just yet.

The main question is, is NOFILE a realistic concern, and what other problem=
s=20
might there be, in terms of making these heavier objects? Besides memory us=
age=20
I can't think of any, but of course I don't have much knowledge of this are=
a.

Alternatively, maybe there's another more lightweight way to store per-proc=
ess=20
data?
