Thanks for sharing your experiences at Google. This helps put things in
perspective.

I would really like to know more about Google's per-numa-node vcpus implementation.
I suspect you guys may have taken a different turn somewhere in the design which
led to these results. But having not seen that implementation, I can only guess.

I notice the following Google-specific prototype extension in tcmalloc:

  // This is a prototype extension to the rseq() syscall.  Since a process may
  // run on only a few cores at a time, we can use a dense set of "v(irtual)
  // cpus."  This can reduce cache requirements, as we only need N caches for
  // the cores we actually run on simultaneously, rather than a cache for every
  // physical core.
  union {
    struct {
      short numa_node_id;
      short vcpu_id;
    };
    int vcpu_flat;
  };

Can you tell me more about the way the numa_node_id and vcpu_id are allocated
internally, and how they are expected to be used by userspace ?

The optimizations I propose keep those "tightly packed" characteristics, but skip
the atomic operations in common scenarios. I'll welcome benchmarks of the added
overhead in representative workloads.

Thanks for your input. It really helps steering the effort in the right direction.
