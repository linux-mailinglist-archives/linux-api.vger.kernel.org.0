I would tend to agree with you. But if the man page provides an appropriate=
=20
warning that such DoS is the price to pay, wouldn't you say it is sufficien=
t?=20
I guess you will say no :-)

Thus, if you can convince Greg to allow us creating another device node, I =
am=20
definitely not in the way of creating and using it. All my suggestions simp=
ly=20
try to bridge the gap between Greg's rather reluctant agreement and our nee=
ds.

The good thing is IMHO that we are only talking about the actual kernel/use=
r=20
interface. The plumbing behind it will be identical - at least in my LRNG=20
implementation, I can use the very same handler function for accessing the=
=20
TRNG with either the device file or the getrandom syscall. I guess the same=
=20
would be applicable to any possible random.c TRNG implementation.

I am in violent agreement.
