It would be nicer if that page just contained an incrementing counter,
instead of a UUID. It's not like the application cares *what* the UUID
changed to, just that it *did* change and all RNGs state now needs to
be reseeded from the kernel, right? And an application can't reliably
read the entire UUID from the memory mapping anyway, because the VM
might be forked in the middle.

So I think your kernel driver should detect UUID changes and then turn
those into a monotonically incrementing counter. (Probably 64 bits
wide?) (That's probably also a little bit faster than comparing an
entire UUID.)

An option might be to put that counter into the vDSO, instead of a
separate VMA; but I don't know how the other folks feel about that.
Andy, do you have opinions on this? That way, normal userspace code
that uses this infrastructure wouldn't have to mess around with a
special device at all. And it'd be usable in seccomp sandboxes and so
on without needing special plumbing. And libraries wouldn't have to
call open() and mess with file descriptor numbers.

Does this mean that code that uses the memory mapping to detect
changes is still supposed to confirm generation IDs? What about
multithreaded processes, especially ones that use libraries - if a
library opens a single file descriptor that is used from multiple
threads, is the library required to synchronize all its threads before
confirming the change? That seems like it could get messy. And it
again means that this interface can't easily be used from inside
seccomp sandboxes.

(Linux doesn't have "file handles". Technically close() just closes a
file descriptor, and if that file descriptor points to the same file
description object (aka struct file) as another file descriptor,
nothing happens.)

In case we actually keep this API, you should use O_CLOEXEC here.

Can you describe what value such an "Orchestrator" would add? Because
it seems to me like this will just unnecessarily complicate things.

What happens if the UUID changes between the previous two calls? Then
the outdated watcher count will go out of sync, right?

(But as I've said, I think that maybe the outdated watcher counting is
a bad idea in general, and we should just get rid of it.)

If the VM is again forked in the middle of this, will userspace see a
torn UUID (consisting of half old and half new value)?

This doesn't work, you also need to clear VM_MAYWRITE. See e.g. binder_mmap().

Also, I think mmap handlers for special mappings like this usually
directly install the page inside the mmap handler, using something
like vm_insert_page(). And then they don't need a ->fault handler.

(But if we decide to put this into the vDSO, the whole memory mapping
thing would become unnecessary anyway.)

You don't need to define a compat_ioctl if the normal ioctl handler is the same.

If we know that the VM just got forked, we should probably also make
sure that we reseed the kernel's internal RNG before we tell userspace
to fetch new RNG seeds from the kernel? Otherwise this is kinda
pointless. Or are we already taking care of that elsewhere? If not, we
should probably mix the UUID into the entropy pool (at least
`write_pool(&input_pool, uuid, sizeof(uuid_t))`, although technically
it would be better to do it in a way that ensures that userspace can't
write the same value into the RNG - maybe we should introduce type
prefixes into write_pool()?) and then trigger a reseed of everything
else (`crng_reseed(&primary_crng, &input_pool)`).
