Sorry for not mentioning that.  I had tracked it down.  It was
fundamentally in the scheduler headers changes removing an include of
task_work.h, so it didn't feel like there was anything I could do in my
tree.  I asked Ingo if he could fix his tree and unfortunately forgot
about it.

For the record there were also a couple of other pretty trivial
conflicts, the removal of nds32, some block_cgroup header where
an adjacent line was modified to what I was changing.  But it thankfully
looks like none of those caused you any problems.

Sorry about all of that I am about that.  I am running pretty weak this
last couple of days as a cold has been running through the household.


Dumb question because this seems to burning a few extra creativity
points.  Is there any way to create a signed tag and a branch with the
same name?  Or in general is there a good way to manage topic branches
and then tag them at the end before I send them?

Having a tag and a branch with the same name seems to completely confuse
git and it just tells me no I won't push anything to another git tree,
because what you are asking me to do is ambiguous.  So now I am having
to come up with two names for each topic branch, even if I only push the
tags upstream.

I feel like there is a best practice on how to manage tags and topic
branches and I just haven't seen it yet.

Eric
