Dave Chinner wrote at https://lkml.kernel.org/r/ZQo94mCzV7hOrVkh@dread.disaster.area
as a response to "We don't care about out of tree filesystems.":

  In this case, we most certainly do care. Downstream distros support
  all sorts of out of tree filesystems loaded via kernel modules, so a
  syscall that is used to uniquely identify a filesystem type to
  userspace *must* have a mechanism for the filesystem to provide that
  unique identifier to userspace.

  Fundamentally, the kernel does not and should not dictate what
  filesystem types it supports; the user decides what filesystem they
  need to use, and it is the kernel's job to provide infrastructure
  that works with that user's choice.

Can you see? What you are trying to is NACKed by simple s/filesystem/LSM/g .

The kernel is ultimately there for users. The kernel is never there for doing patent
acquisition competition. If the LSM community accepts only LSMs which won the patent
acquisition competition as in-tree (as described in "ANN: new LSM guidelines"),
the LSM community is responsible for allowing any publicly available LSMs to live as
out of tree modules.

Unless the policy is updated to approve any publicly available LSMs and assign a unique
identifier (which can be passed to the syscalls introduced by this series) to each
publicly available LSM, this series is a regression.

The "[PATCH v15 01/11] LSM: Identify modules by more than name" is exactly doing
"LSM: allow only in-tree LSM modules, lock out out-of-tree LSM modules".
Nack, Nack, Nack, Nack, Nack!!!!!
