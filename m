It's a sensible concern. I think when I discussed this with Alexandre
Julliard (the Wine maintainer, CC'd) the conclusion was this wasn't
something we were concerned about.

While the current model *does* allow for processes to arbitrarily mess
with each other, accidentally or not, I think we're not concerned with
the scope of that than we are about implementing a whole scheduler in
user space.

=46or one, you can't corrupt the wineserver state this way=E2=80=94wineserv=
er
being sort of like a dedicated process that handles many of the things
that a kernel would, and so sometimes needs to set or reset events, or
perform NTSYNC_IOC_KILL_MUTEX, but never relies on ntsync object state.
Whereas trying to implement a scheduler in user space would involve the
wineserver taking locks, and hence other processes could deadlock.

=46or two, it's probably a lot harder to mess with that internal state
accidentally.

[There is also a potential problem where some broken applications
create a million (literally) sync objects. Making these into files runs
into NOFILE. We did specifically push distributions and systemd to
increase those limits because an older solution *did* use eventfds and
*did* run into those limits. Since that push was successful I don't
know if this is *actually* a concern anymore, but avoiding files is
probably not a bad thing either.]
