I think the mention of O_DIRECTORY here is a bit misleading. That
flag does not need to be used. O_RDONLY or O_PATH suffices; I 
reworded somewhat.

Here I presume you mean things like the "no internal processes 
rule" and the restriction around putting a process into a
"domain invalid" cgroup, right? I reworded a things and added
a couple of cases in ERRORS.

Thanks for these use cases; that's great!

So, I did some fairly heavy editing, which resulted in the
following (the sum of the diffs is shown at the end of this
mail):

       CLONE_INTO_CGROUP (since Linux 5.7)
              By default, a child process is placed in the same version 2
              cgroup  as  its  parent.   The CLONE_INTO_CGROUP allows the
              child process to  be  created  in  a  different  version  2
              cgroup.   (Note  that CLONE_INTO_CGROUP has effect only for
              version 2 cgroups.)

              In order to place the child process in a different  cgroup,
              the caller specifies CLONE_INTO_CGROUP in cl_args.flags and
              passes a file descriptor that refers to a version 2  cgroup
              in  the cl_args.cgroup field.  (This file descriptor can be
              obtained by opening a cgroup v2 directory file using either
              the  O_RDONLY  or  the  O_PATH flag.)  Note that all of the
              usual restrictions (described in cgroups(7)) on  placing  a
              process into a version 2 cgroup apply.

              Spawning  a  process  into a cgroup different from the par‐
              ent's cgroup makes it possible for  a  service  manager  to
              directly  spawn  new services into dedicated cgroups.  This
              eliminates the accounting jitter that would  be  caused  if
              the  child  process was first created in the same cgroup as
              the parent and then moved  into  the  target  cgroup.   The
              CLONE_INTO_CGROUP  flag  also allows the creation of frozen
              child processes by spawning  them  into  a  frozen  cgroup.
              (See  cgroups(7)  for  a  description  of  the freezer con‐
              troller.)  For threaded applications (or even thread imple‐
              mentations  which  make  use of cgroups to limit individual
              threads), it is possible to establish a fixed cgroup layout
              before  spawning  each  thread  directly  into  its  target
              cgroup.

ERRORS
       EBUSY (clone3() only)
              CLONE_INTO_CGROUP  was  specified in cl_args.flags, but the
              file descriptor specified in  cl_args.cgroup  refers  to  a
              version 2 cgroup in which a domain controller is enabled.

       EOPNOTSUP (clone3() only)
              CLONE_INTO_CGROUP  was  specified in cl_args.flags, but the
              file descriptor specified in  cl_args.cgroup  refers  to  a
              version 2 cgroup that is in the domain invalid state.

Look okay to you?

Thanks,

Michael
