That might be the case currently because KSM is an opt-in feature that
has to be explicitly enabled. The existing interface only allows to
enable it by MADV_MERGEABLE but now you are proposing an extension when
there would be other way to achieve the same (with a wider scope but
that is not really all that important). MADV_UNMERGEABLE has a well
defined behavior even on VMAs which are not marked for merging.

Let's say that somebody would like to use a process wide setup except
for few special mappings because merging is not really desirable for
whatever reason. How do you achieve that?

I disagree. It clearly drops the mergeable flag so it effectivelly disallow
merging.
