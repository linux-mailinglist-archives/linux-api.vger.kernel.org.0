I updated this bit.

Hmm.

I don't think that RT people can live with the latency spike. The
problem is that it is not deterministic in terms *when* it happens and
*how*long* does it need to complete. Also it is not visible so you end
up with additional 100us and you have no idea why.
compaction is "okay" in the setup / configuration phase when the mlock()
pages aren't around / the RT task is disabled. So it does not disturb
the RT load.

Allowing the user to change the knob and spitting a warning is probably
good. So we have a preferred default and the user is aware if it is
changed with or without his knowledge.
Let me send a patch in a bitâ€¦

Sebastian
