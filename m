I'm not sure if those settings are strictly related to the change I am
proposing which makes epoll-based busy poll something that can be
enabled/disabled on a per-epoll context basis and allows the budget to be
set as well, but maybe I am missing something? Sorry for my
misunderstanding if so.

IMHO: a single system-wide busy poll setting is difficult to use
properly and it is unforunate that the packet budget is hardcoded. It would
be extremely useful to be able to set both of these on a per-epoll basis
and I think my suggested change helps to solve this.

Please let me know.

Re the two settings you noted:

I didn't mention those in the interest of brevity, but yes they can be used
instead of or in addition to what I've described above.

While those settings are very useful, IMHO, they have their own issues
because they are system-wide as well. If they were settable per-NAPI, that
would make it much easier to use them because they could be enabled for the
NAPIs which are being busy-polled by applications that support busy-poll.

Imagine you have 3 types of apps running side-by-side:
  - A low latency epoll-based busy poll app,
  - An app where latency doesn't matter as much, and
  - A latency sensitive legacy app which does not yet support epoll-based
    busy poll.

In the first two cases, the settings you mention would be helpful or not
make any difference, but in the third case the system-wide impact might be
undesirable because having IRQs fire might be important to keep latency
down.

If your comment was more that my cover letter should have mentioned these,
I can include that in a future cover letter or suggest some kernel
documentation which will discuss all of these features and how they relate
to each other.

There is another change [1] I've been looking at from a research paper [2]
which does something similar to what you've described above -- it keeps
IRQs suppressed during busy polling. The paper suggests a performance
improvement is measured when using a mechanism like this to keep IRQs off.
Please see the paper for more details.

I haven't had a chance to reach out to the authors or to tweak this patch
to attempt an RFC / submission for it, but it seems fairly promising in my
initial synthetic tests.

When I tested their patch, as you might expect, no IRQs were generated at
all for the NAPIs that were being busy polled, but the rest of the
NAPIs and queues were generating IRQs as expected.

Regardless of the above patch: I think my proposed change is helpful and
the IRQ suppression bit can be handled in a separate change in the future.
What do you think?

I am aware of kthread based NAPI polling, yes, but I was not aware that
busy polling was being considered as a feature for them, thanks for the
head's up.

> Thank you

Thanks for your comments - I appreciate your time and attention.

Could you let me know if your comments are meant as a n-ack or similar?

I am unsure if you were suggesting that per-epoll context based busy
polling is unneeded/unnecessary from your perspective - or if it was more
of a hint that I should be including more context somewhere in the kernel
documentation as part of this change :)

Again, IMHO, allowing epoll based busy polling to be configured on a
per-epoll context basis (both the usecs and the packet budget) really help
to make epoll-based busy polling much more usable by user apps.

Thanks,
Joe
