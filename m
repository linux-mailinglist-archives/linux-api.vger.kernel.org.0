Yes, if glibc adds GRND_SECURE_UNBOUNDED_INITIAL_WAIT to gentropy(3),
then this exercise would indeed be invalidated. Hopefully,
coordination with glibc will be done so it won't happen... @Florian?

Afterwards, a sane approach would be for gentropy(3) to be deprecated,
and to add getentropy_secure_unbounded_initial_wait(3) and
getentropy_insecure(3).

Note that this V5 patch does not claim to fully solve the problem, but
it will:

  1. Pinpoint to the processes causing system boots to block
  
  2. Tell people what correct alternative to use when facing problem
     #1 above, through the proposed getrandom_wait(7) manpage. That
     manpage page will fully describe the problem, and advise
     user-space to either use the new getrandom flags, or the new
     glibc gentropy_*() variants.
