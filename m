Thanks for confirming this.

I think sysfs makes more sense. In a production system you have a single
TPM, and that's why there is a single global event log coming from the
BIOS. That's why securityfs makes sense for the event log.

However, PCRs themselves are device local, Linux supports multiple TPM
devices, and sometimes for development and testing purposes you might
want to do this.
