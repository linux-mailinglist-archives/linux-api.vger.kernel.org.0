If userland sees the failure it can do whatever the developer/distro
packager thought suitable for the system facing this condition.

Definitely, that's what Linus' proposal was doing. Sleeping for some time
is what I call "vaguely reasonable".

Oh absolutely!

It depends how it's used. I'd claim that we certainly use randoms for
other things (such as ASLR/hashtables) *before* using them to generate
long lived keys thus we can have a bit more time to get some more
entropy before reaching the point of producing these keys.

Without a timeout it's sure we'll still face some situations where
it blocks forever, which is the current problem.

You don't necessarily have such a device, especially when you're
in an initramfs. It's precisely where userland can be smarter. When
the caller is sfdisk for example, it does have more chances to try
to perform I/O than when it's a tiny http server starting to present
a configuration page.

I think I agree.

I have no opinion on this, lacking the skills to evaluate the situation.
What I can say for sure is that I've faced the non-booting issue quite a
number of times on headless systems, and conversely in the 2.4 era, my
front reverse-proxy by then had the same SSH key as 89 other machines on
the net. So there's surely a sweet spot to find between those two extremes.
I tend to think that waiting *a little bit* for the *first* random is
acceptable, even 10-15s, by the time the user starts to think about
pressing the reset button the system might finish to boot. Hashing some
RAM locations and the RTC when present can also help a little bit. If
at least my machine by then had combined the RTC's date and time with
the hash, chances for a key collision would have gone down to one over
many thousands.
