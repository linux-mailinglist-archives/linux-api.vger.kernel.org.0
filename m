Thanks for a good example.
Hm, in the case of rt_sigreturn, it has no other way to do it so it
needs to use syscall. OTOH, sys_uretprobe is only for performance
optimization, and the performance may depend on the architecture.

Syscall table is compiled as a fixed array, so if we increase
the number, we need more tables. Of course this just increase 1 entry
and at least for x86 we already allocated bigger table, so it is OK.
But I'm just afraid if we can add more syscalls without any clear
rules, we may fill the tables with more specific syscalls.

Ah, we also should follow this document.

https://docs.kernel.org/process/adding-syscalls.html

Let me Cc linux-api@vger.kernel.org.

Thanks, if this is discussed enough and agreed from other maintainers,
I can safely pick this on my tree.

OK, so this syscall is something like coding int3 without debugger.

Can we make this syscall and uprobe behavior clearer? As you said, if
the application use sigreturn or longjump, it may skip returns and
shadow stack entries are left in the kernel. In such cases, can uretprobe
detect it properly, or just crash the process (or process runs wrongly)?

OK, but as I said it is just for performance optimization, that is
a bit different from rt_sigreturn case.
