This is mostly correct. NT has file descriptors and descriptions (the
former is called a "handle"), though unlike Unix access bits are
specific to the *descriptor* (handle). I don't know if anything uses=20
it, but we do currently implement that basic functionality, so I can't
say that nothing does either.

So inasmuch as access to someone else's object is a concern, access to
your object with bits you don't have permission for could be a concern
along the same lines. However, from conversation with Alexandre I
believe it'd be fine to just implement those checks in user space.

=46or whatever it's worth, this particular thing wouldn't be a concern;
Wine's "kernel" daemon already has to detect when a process dies and
close all its outstanding handles.
