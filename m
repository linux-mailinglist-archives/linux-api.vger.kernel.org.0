Using the sprintX variants you maintain a cursor pointer, so they all
look like

char *cursor = buf;

...

cursor += sprintX(cursor, "...", ...

...

return cursor - buf;

So the input is a relative cursor and the output is the additional
offset.  I'm not claiming it's the best interface but it is hard to get
wrong, just that if we're going to force a new interface we should make
it much better.

with sysfs_emit_at you use an offset "cursor" but it's hard to know
without reading the function how to do it because the return is
relative rather than absolute.  To have an interface it would be hard
to misuse, I think the best way would be to take a pointer to the
offset and adjust it after use, so

sysfs_emit_at(buf, &offset, ...);

That way it returns void so you can't use it in place of 

return sysfs_emit()

And you don't have to worry about whether the return is absolute or
relative because it adjusts the pointer for you.

The whole point about Rusty and interfaces is that if you are going to
invent new interfaces you should make them easy to get right and hard
to misuse.  A function you can't figure out how to use until you read
the source is about 2/10 on the rusty scale:
