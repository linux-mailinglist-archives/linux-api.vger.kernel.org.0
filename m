I can see that this is not a trivial interface to use but I do not
think this would be too hard to be usable. There is certainly some
coordination required between the external and the target tasks. But
that is to be expected IMHO. You do not really want to configure merging
without actually understanding what the application does and whether
that is really OK. Right?

Besides that, as far as I remember, the process_madvise interface
doesn't really require exact vmas to be provided and a single range can
span multiple VMAs.

What is the problem with the prctl extension?

I am not sure I understand. Could you be more specific?
