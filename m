Sorry, I haven't been feeling too well and as such procastinated on this
because thinking is required :/ Trying to pick up the bits.

I couldn't make that work for wakeups; when a thread blocks in a
random syscall there is no userspace to wake the next thread. And since
it seems required in this case, it's easier and more consistent to
always do it.

Yes, this is indeed required; I've found the same when trying to build
the userspace server loop. And yes, I'm starting to see where you're
coming from.

	S0 running A

Therefore:

	S0::state == RUNNABLE
	A::server_tid = S0.tid
	A::state == RUNNING

you want A to switch to B, therefore:

	B::state == RUNNABLE

if B is not yet on S0 then:

	B::server_tid = S0.tid;

finally:

0:
	A::next_tid = B.tid;
1:
	A::state = RUNNABLE:
2:
	sys_umcg_wait();
3:

So the problem is tripping umcg_notify_resume() on the labels 1 and 2,
right? tripping it on 0 and 3 is trivially correct.

If we trip it on 1 and !(A::state & TG_PREEMPT), then nothing, since
::state == RUNNING we'll just continue onwards and all is well. That is,
nothing has happened yet.

However, if we trip it on 2: we're screwed. Because at that point
::state is scribbled.

No, the failure case is different; umcg_notify_resume() will simply
block A until someone sets A::state == RUNNING and kicks it, which will
be no-one.

Now, the above situation is actually simple to fix, but it gets more
interesting when we're using sys_umcg_wait() to build wait primitives.
Because in that case we get stuff like:

	for (;;) {
		self->state = RUNNABLE;
		smp_mb();
		if (cond)
			break;
		sys_umcg_wait();
	}
	self->state = RUNNING;

And we really need to not block and also not do sys_umcg_wait() early.

So yes, I agree that we need a special case here that ensures
umcg_notify_resume() doesn't block. Let me ponder naming and comments.
Either a TF_COND_WAIT or a whole new state. I can't decide yet.

Now, obviously if you do a random syscall anywhere around here, you get
to keep the pieces :-)



I've also added ::next_tid to the whole umcg_pin_pages() thing, and made
it so that ::next_tid gets cleared when it's been used. That way things
like:

	self->next_tid = pick_from_runqueue();
	sys_that_is_expected_to_sleep();
	if (self->next_tid) {
		return_to_runqueue(self->next_tid);
		self->next_tid = 0;
	}

Are much simpler to manage. Either it did sleep and ::next_tid is
consumed, or it didn't sleep and it needs to be returned to the
runqueue.
