Yeah, you're right.

Thanks for the sha1 and for digging around. Now, I read
74e37200de8e ("proc: cleanup/simplify get_task_state/task_state_array")
as "get_task_state() isn't clear vs what value is actually exposed to
userspace" rather than "get_task_state() could expose things userspace
doesn't know what to do with".

06eb61844d84 ("sched/debug: Add explicit TASK_IDLE printing") for instance
seems to suggest extending the states OK, but you're right that this then
requires updating ps' manpage.

Alternatively, TASK_RTLOCK_WAIT could be masqueraded as
TASK_(UN)INTERRUPTIBLE when reported to userspace - it is actually somewhat
similar, unlike TASK_IDLE vs TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE for instance. The
handling in get_task_state() will be fugly, but it might be preferable over
exposing a detail userspace might not need to be made aware of?
