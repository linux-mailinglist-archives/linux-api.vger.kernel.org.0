There's always that possibility.

We have to ensure that we move the IRQs by a tuned daemon or some other
userspace script every time there is a net-dev change (eg. device comes up,
creates VFs, etc).

Do you mean a flag based on which we can switch the affinity mask to
housekeeping for all the devices at the time of IRQ distribution?
