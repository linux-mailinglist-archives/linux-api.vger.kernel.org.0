Maybe I=E2=80=99m just cynical, but I expect that, if the feature is availab=
le to everyone, then lots of user programmers will use it even though they d=
on=E2=80=99t need to.  If, on the other hand, there is a barrier to entry, t=
hen people will be more likely to stop and think.

Even gnupg could have been more clever =E2=80=94 when generating a 4096-bit R=
SA key, there is no actual need for 4096 bits of entropy, however entropy is=
 defined. 256 bits would have been more than adequate.

(FWIW, my personal view is that 512 bits, in the sense of =E2=80=9Cthe distr=
ibution being sampled produces no output with probability greater than about=
 2^-512=E2=80=9D, is a good upper limit for even the most paranoid.  This is=
 because it=E2=80=99s reasonable to assume that an attacker can=E2=80=99t do=
 more than 2^128 operations. As djb has noted, multi-target attacks mean tha=
t you can amplify success probability in some cases by a factor that won=E2=80=
=99t exceed 2^128.  Some day, quantum computers might square-root everything=
, giving 512 bits. Actually, quantum computers won=E2=80=99t square root eve=
rything, but much more complicated analysis is needed to get a believable bo=
und.)
