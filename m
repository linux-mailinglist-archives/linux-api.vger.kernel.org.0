OK, so if we take x86-64 as an example, the abort would do:

/* Skip redzone and sigframe */
regs->sp -= 128 + sizeof(struct rt_sigframe);

It's unclear to me what should be the size of rt_sigframe here. Should it
include floating point state as well ?

Then at regs->sp, we can store a signal frame. The interesting bits would
go into (struct rt_sigframe  __user *)->uc which is a struct sigcontext.
It would contain all register state at the point where the critical section
was aborted.

The only register state we really care about is sigcontext "rip", given that
the userspace abort handler can save all other relevant registers by itself.

Then should we populate the other struct rt_sigframe fields or just zero them ?
I wonder what the meaning of "pretcode" and "struct siginfo" would be in the
context of an rseq abort ?

Thanks,

Mathieu
