Does it really? I mean, you are right that some sort of synchronization
(e.g. freezing) is required to prevent from address space modifications.
My question is whether this is really required for something that is
mostly an optimization. Missing some VMAs or failing because of racing
modifications is should be toleratable. Or am I wrong on that?

Add a new prctl "command"

> I don't quite get your point. Can prctl control external process?

Not directly but the properties set by prctl are usually inherited so it
is trivial to create a spawn process to set up the property and exec
into the target application. The target application is not really aware
it has been executed like that so it doesn't really need any
modifications.

But please note that I am not really suggesting to go with prctl. I am
just saying it is a better interface than proc one. I am still not
convinced this really required and I would prefer process_madvise more.

What about MADV_UNMERGEABLE?
