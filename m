Hi Greg,

Thanks a lot for the review. Actually all the sysfs entries under events
are perf monitoring events following the same format documented in 
"Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-bus-event_source-devices-events" and
we added some description in our fpga documentation in patch #1.

Yes, I can add something in ABI directly as well in the next version.
I pasted related descriptions below. I hope this won't block review.

Thank you very much!
Hao


From Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-bus-event_source-devices-events

What: /sys/bus/event_source/devices/<pmu>/events/<event>
Date: 2014/02/24
Contact:        Linux kernel mailing list <linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org>
Description:    Per-pmu performance monitoring events specific to the running system

                Each file (except for some of those with a '.' in them, '.unit'
                and '.scale') in the 'events' directory describes a single
                performance monitoring event supported by the <pmu>. The name
                of the file is the name of the event.

                File contents:

                        <term>[=<value>][,<term>[=<value>]]...

                Where <term> is one of the terms listed under
                /sys/bus/event_source/devices/<pmu>/format/ and <value> is
                a number is base-16 format with a '0x' prefix (lowercase only).
                If a <term> is specified alone (without an assigned value), it
                is implied that 0x1 is assigned to that <term>.

                Examples (each of these lines would be in a seperate file):

                        event=0x2abc
                        event=0x423,inv,cmask=0x3
                        domain=0x1,offset=0x8,starting_index=0xffff
                        domain=0x1,offset=0x8,core=?

                Each of the assignments indicates a value to be assigned to a
                particular set of bits (as defined by the format file
                corresponding to the <term>) in the perf_event structure passed
                to the perf_open syscall.

                In the case of the last example, a value replacing "?" would
                need to be provided by the user selecting the particular event.
                This is referred to as "event parameterization". Event
                parameters have the format 'param=?'.

From Documentation/fpga/dfl.rst added by patch #1.

"
The "events" directory describes the configuration templates for all available
events which can be used with perf tool directly. For example, fab_mmio_read
has the configuration "event=0x06,evtype=0x02,portid=0xff", which shows this
event belongs to fabric type (0x02), the local event id is 0x06 and it is for
overall monitoring (portid=0xff).
