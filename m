Yes this all makes sense. The notification on changes would be excellent,
especially if NAPI IDs get changed for some reason  (e.g. the queue count
is adjusted or the queues are rebuilt by the driver for some reason like a
timeout, etc).

I think the issue I'm solving with SIOCGIFNAME_BY_NAPI_ID is related, but
different.

In my case, SIOCGIFNAME_BY_NAPI_ID identifies which NIC a specific fd from
accept arrived from.

AFAICT, the netlink API wouldn't be able to help me answer that question. I
could use SIOCGIFNAME_BY_NAPI_ID to tell me which NIC the fd is from and
then use netlink to figure out which CPU to bind to (for example), but I
think SIOCGIFNAME_BY_NAPI_ID is still needed.

I'll send an RFC about for that shortly, hope that's OK.

I have seen it while reading the code, yes. I think maybe I missed
something about its interaction with gro_flush_timeout. In my use case,
the machine has no traffic until after the app is started.

In this case, I haven't needed to worry about regular NAPI monopolizing the
CPU and preventing busy poll from working.

Maybe I am missing something more nuanced, though? I'll have another look
at the code, just incase.

I looked last night after I learned about the netlink interface. It does
not look like the driver I am using does, but I can fix that fairly easily,
I think.

I'll try to send a patch for this next week.
