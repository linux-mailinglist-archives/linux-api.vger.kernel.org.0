Yes.

Yes.

My suggestion is to use a counter *in the UAPI*, not in the hypervisor
protocol. (And as long as that counter can only miss increments in a
cryptographically negligible fraction of cases, everything's fine.)

And this is what *the hypervisor protocol* gives us (which could be
very useful for reseeding the kernel RNG).

Sure, from a theoretical standpoint, it would be a little bit nicer if
the hypervisor protocol included a generation number along with the
128-bit random value. But AFAIU it doesn't, so if we want this to just
work under Microsoft's existing hypervisor, we'll have to make do with
checking whether the random value changed. :P
