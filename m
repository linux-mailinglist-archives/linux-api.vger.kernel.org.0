Then, the

  The calling application can use this list determine what LSM
  specific actions it might take. That might include choosing an
  output format, determining required privilege or bypassing
  security module specific behavior.

part should be removed from the description. Instead, the description should
emphasis that the numeric LSM ID values are there in order to allow
identifying what LSM modules are active without interpreting string LSM names
in /sys/kernel/security/lsm .

I know nothing about netlabel. But can userspace make such assumption from
this granularity? For example, if TOMOYO and AppArmor start supporting
netlabel configuration, your assumption

  If Smack and SELinux not enabled on the system there is no point in
  setting up a netlabel configuration

becomes no longer true. It is also possible that a new LSM implementation
obtains an LSM ID for that LSM, and starts supporting netlabel configuration
some timer later. I don't know if we come to the point where we can enable
SELinux and Smack at the same time. But when it becomes possible to enable
SELinux and Smack at the same time, the userspace might have already written
code based on current situation that netlabel configuration are exclusive. Then,
someday starting to return both LSM ID for SELinux and LSM ID for Smack might
confuse userspace.

Thus, it might be safe to determine what LSMs are active from the LSM ID values
returned from the system call. But it is not safe to assume what functionality
is active (e.g. netlabel configuration is interpreted) from the LSM ID values
returned from the system call.

If you want to allow userspace to make such assumption using the system call,
the granularity the system call returns needs to be what access control mechanism
(not only LSM modules but also eBPF-based access control mechanisms) hooks which
LSM hooks. More information than interpreting string LSM names in 
/sys/kernel/security/lsm will be needed.

Enumerating only LSM modules are not useful. "ID for access control mechanisms
that can be controlled via LSM hooks" will be needed.

I conclude that LSM ID values are pointless and are NOT needed.
