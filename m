+Performance Counters
+====================
+Performance reporting is one private feature implemented in FME. It could
+supports several independent, system-wide, device counter sets in hardware to
+monitor and count for performance events, including "basic", "cache", "fabric",
+"vtd" and "vtd_sip" counters. Users could use standard perf tool to monitor
+FPGA cache hit/miss rate, transaction number, interface clock counter of AFU
+and other FPGA performance events.
+
+Different FPGA devices may have different counter sets, it depends on hardware
+implementation. e.g. some discrete FPGA cards don't have any cache. User could
+use "perf list" to check which perf events are supported by target hardware.
+
+In order to allow user to use standard perf API to access these performance
+counters, driver creates a perf PMU, and related sysfs interfaces in
+/sys/bus/event_source/devices/fme* to describe available perf events and
+configuration options.
+
+The "format" directory describes the format of the config field of struct
+perf_event_attr. There are 3 bitfields for config, "evtype" defines which type
+the perf event belongs to. "event" is the identity of the event within its
+category. "portid" is introduced to decide counters set to monitor on FPGA
+overall data or a specific port.
+
+The "events" directory describes the configuration templates for all available
+events which can be used with perf tool directly. For example, fab_mmio_read
+has the configuration "event=0x06,evtype=0x02,portid=0xff", which shows this
+event belongs to fabric type (0x02), the local event id is 0x06 and it is for
+overall monitoring (portid=0xff).
+
+Example usage of perf can be:
+
+$# perf list |grep fme
+
+ fme0/fab_mmio_read/                              [Kernel PMU event]
+<...>
+ fme0/fab_port_mmio_read,portid=?/                [Kernel PMU event]
+<...>
+
+$# perf stat -a -e fme0/fab_mmio_read/ <command>
+or
+$# perf stat -a -e fme0/event=0x06,evtype=0x02,portid=0xff/ <command>
+or
+$# perf stat -a -e fme0/config=0xff2006/ <command>
+
+Another example, fab_port_mmio_read monitors mmio read of a specific port. So
+its configuration template is "event=0x06,evtype=0x01,portid=?". The portid
+should be explicitly set.
+
+Its usage of perf can be:
+
+$# perf stat -a -e fme0/fab_port_mmio_read,portid=0x0/ <command>
+or
+$# perf stat -a -e fme0/event=0x06,evtype=0x02,portid=0x0/ <command>
+or
+$# perf stat -a -e fme0/config=0x2006/ <command>
+
+Please note for fabric counters, overall perf events (fab_*) and port perf
+events (fab_port_*) actually share one set of counters in hardware, so it can't
+monitor both at the same time. If this set of counters is configured to monitor
+overall data, then per port perf data is not supported. See below example.
+
+$# perf stat -e fme0/fab_mmio_read/,fme0/fab_port_mmio_write,\
+                                                    portid=0/ sleep 1
+
+ Performance counter stats for 'system wide':
+
+                 3      fme0/fab_mmio_read/
+   <not supported>      fme0/fab_port_mmio_write,portid=0x0/
+
+       1.001750904 seconds time elapsed
+
+The driver also provides a "cpumask" sysfs attribute, which always shows fixed
+value cpu0 as all perf events are from system-wide counters on FPGA device.
+
+The current driver does not support sampling. So "perf record" is unsupported.
+
