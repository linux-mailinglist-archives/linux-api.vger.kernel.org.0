Yes, but I would expect the rseq registration arguments to have a rseq_len
of offsetofend(struct rseq, tg_vcpu_id) when userspace wants the tg_vcpu_id
feature to be supported (but not the following features).

Then, as we append additional features as follow-up fields, those
eventually become requested by glibc by increasing the requested size.

Then it's kind of weird to receive a registration size which is not
aligned on 32-byte, but then use internal knowledge of the structure
alignment in the kernel code to write beyond the requested size. And all
this in a case where we are returning to user-space after a preemption,
so I don't expect this extra switch/case to cause significant overhead.

Yes, it's a good idea. I'm not too familiar with the auxiliary vector.
Are we talking about the kernel's

fs/binfmt_elf.c:fill_auxv_note()

?

Thanks,

Mathieu
