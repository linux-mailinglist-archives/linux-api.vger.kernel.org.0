My definition of TRNG is identical to the German AIS 31 and I guess identic=
al=20
to your definition of a TRNG.

A TRNG will produce an amount of random data that is equal to the amount of=
=20
"fresh" entropy that was provided by the noise source. I.e. it should be=20
identical to the blocking_pool behavior.

This definition is slightly stricter than the SP800-90A definition of "a DR=
BG=20
with prediction resistance" which requires a reseed with entropy equal to t=
he=20
security strength of the DRBG, but allows one generate operation which at m=
ost=20
generates 2^19 random bits.

Such TRNG has two components

1. the noise source / the entropy pool

2. the random number generator

All I try to say is that the random number generator does not need to be a=
=20
special implementation of, say, a blocking_pool, but it can be any type of=
=20
DRNG (ChaCha20, SP800-90A DRBG, ...).

To manage that DRNG, the logic needs to ensure that the maximum entropy=20
content assumed to be present in the DRNG is min(entropy_from_noise_source,=
=20
security_strength_DRNG). For the case of the blocking_pool, the security=20
strength is 1024 bits which means that at most the blocking_pool can hold u=
p=20
to 1024 bits. With a ChaCha20 DRNG, the security strength is 256 bits.=20
SP800-90A defines the security strengths of the DRBGs.

That said, for a TRNG, the DRNG part must be seeded with the amount of entr=
opy=20
equaling the requested numbers of random bits, but at most with entropy=20
equaling the security strength of the DRNG. If the caller wants more random=
=20
data, the request must be chunked to ensure that the DRNG is always reseede=
d=20
before satisfying the chunk of the request.

Correct, and I am not disputing it. And I think that making Linux to behave=
=20
like the BSD's and guaranteeing that the DRNG is fully seeded based on Andy=
's=20
patch set is a good thing.

All I try to say is that there are use cases where a TRNG with the initiall=
y=20
defined operation is required. This most prominent use case is the German A=
IS=20
31 and the (re)seeding requirements of deterministic RNGs.

Thank you, Andy. Yes. I am trying to propose a separate interface.

Our discussion currently produced the following suggestions:

=2D add a new GRND_TRUERANDOM flag to getrandom(2) which allows access to t=
he=20
TRNG. Andy did not like it because he mentioned that it may be misused sinc=
e=20
the syscall is unprivileged. I had some suggestions to overcome this proble=
m,=20
but not all of Andy's considerations could be addressed with this suggestio=
n.=20
As an idea, my current LRNG system call implementation looks like:

SYSCALL_DEFINE3(getrandom, char __user *, buf, size_t, count,
                unsigned int, flags)
{
        if (flags & ~(GRND_NONBLOCK|GRND_RANDOM|GRND_INSECURE|
GRND_TRUERANDOM))
                return -EINVAL;

        /*
         * Requesting insecure and blocking randomness at the same time mak=
es
         * no sense.
         */
        if ((flags &
             (GRND_INSECURE|GRND_RANDOM)) =3D=3D (GRND_INSECURE|GRND_RANDOM=
))
                return -EINVAL;

        /* Only allow GRND_TRUERANDOM by itself or with NONBLOCK */
        if ((flags & GRND_TRUERANDOM) &&
            ((flags &~ GRND_TRUERANDOM) !=3D 0) &&
            ((flags &~ (GRND_TRUERANDOM | GRND_NONBLOCK)) !=3D 0))
                return -EINVAL;

        if (count > INT_MAX)
                count =3D INT_MAX;

        if (flags & GRND_TRUERANDOM)
                return lrng_read_common_block(flags & GRND_NONBLOCK, buf,
                                              count, lrng_trng_get);
        if (flags & GRND_INSECURE)
                return lrng_sdrng_read(NULL, buf, count, NULL);

        return lrng_read_common_block(flags & GRND_NONBLOCK, buf, count,
                                      lrng_sdrng_get_sleep);

}


=2D Andy mentioned that he likes the approach with having another new char=
=20
device with permissions 440 to provide an interface to the TRNG as more=20
appropriate. However, Greg was reluctant to add a new device file.

I personally am indifferent. All I am suggesting is to have a TRNG offered =
to=20
user space.
