Hi Greg,

Thanks a lot for the review. : )

Perf sysfs files allow this kind of output, so some perf drivers are using
the similar format for their jobs.

Examples from my machine.

 # cat /sys/bus/event_source/devices/cpu/events/cycles-ct
 event=0x3c,in_tx=1,in_tx_cp=1
 # cat /sys/bus/event_source/devices/cpu/events/el-start
 event=0xc8,umask=0x1
 # cat /sys/bus/event_source/devices/cpu/events/instructions
 event=0xc0
 # cat /sys/bus/event_source/devices/cpu/events/branch-instructions
 event=0xc4

See arch/x86/events/intel/core.c

 EVENT_ATTR_STR(cycles-ct, cycles_ct, "event=0x3c,in_tx=1,in_tx_cp=1");
 ...

And descriptions/examples from ABI/testing/sysfs-bus-event_source-devices-events

What: /sys/bus/event_source/devices/<pmu>/events/<event>
Date: 2014/02/24
Contact:	Linux kernel mailing list <linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org>
Description:	Per-pmu performance monitoring events specific to the running system

		Each file (except for some of those with a '.' in them, '.unit'
		and '.scale') in the 'events' directory describes a single
		performance monitoring event supported by the <pmu>. The name
		of the file is the name of the event.

		File contents:

			<term>[=<value>][,<term>[=<value>]]...

		Where <term> is one of the terms listed under
		/sys/bus/event_source/devices/<pmu>/format/ and <value> is
		a number is base-16 format with a '0x' prefix (lowercase only).
		If a <term> is specified alone (without an assigned value), it
		is implied that 0x1 is assigned to that <term>.

		Examples (each of these lines would be in a seperate file):

			event=0x2abc
			event=0x423,inv,cmask=0x3
			domain=0x1,offset=0x8,starting_index=0xffff
			domain=0x1,offset=0x8,core=?

		Each of the assignments indicates a value to be assigned to a
		particular set of bits (as defined by the format file
		corresponding to the <term>) in the perf_event structure passed
		to the perf_open syscall.

		In the case of the last example, a value replacing "?" would
		need to be provided by the user selecting the particular event.
		This is referred to as "event parameterization". Event
		parameters have the format 'param=?'.

So this is not something new introduced by this patch.

Actually events are filled into this "events" from several different groups
via pmu->attr_update[1].

	pmu->attr_update =      fme_perf_events_groups;

pmu->attr_update allows us to update "events" directories with attributes that
depend on various HW conditions. In our case, several different groups with
different is_visible functions are filled into "events" using this method.
And several existing pmu drivers (e.g. arch/x86/events/intel/cstate.c) are
using the same way (having an empty directory first and update it using
pmu->attr_update).

But I have to admit that I should add some comments there to avoid confusion,
sorry, will do that in the next version.
