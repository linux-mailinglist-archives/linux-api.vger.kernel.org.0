I think you should be able to get this functionality via the netdev-genl 
API to get napi parameters. It returns ifindex as one of the parameters 
and you should able to get the name from ifindex.

$ ./cli.py --spec netdev.yaml --do napi-get --json='{"id": 593}'
{'id': 593, 'ifindex': 12, 'irq': 291, 'pid': 3727}

Not yet. Please go ahead and work on it it if you have time.
napi-get and napi-set can be extended to show and set these parameters.
