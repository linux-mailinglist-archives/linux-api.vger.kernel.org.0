If it is agreed that the CAP_SYS_ADMIN is too strict of a requirement
then yes, this should be squashed into the original patch. There is no
real reason to create a potential bisection headache by changing the
permission model in a later patch.

From my POV, I would agree that CAP_SYS_ADMIN is just too strict of a
requirement.

I didn't really have time to follow recent discussions but I would argue
that the operation is not really destructive or seriously harmful. All
applications can already have their memory (almost) equally THP
collapsed by khupaged with the proposed process_madvise semantic.

NOHUGEMEM and prctl opt out from THP are both honored AFAIU and the only
difference is the global THP killswitch behavior which I do not think
warrants the strongest CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (especially because it
doesn't really control all kinds of THPs).

If there is a userspace agent collapsing memory and causing problems
then it can be easily fixed in the userspace. And I find that easier
to do than putting the bar so high that userspace agents would be
unfeasible because of CAP_SYS_ADMIN (which is nono in many cases as it
would allow essentially full control of other stuff). So from practical
POV, risking an extended RSS is really a negligible risk to lose a
potentially useful feature for all others.

Just my 2c
