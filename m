I haven't ... if you read the below you'll see it's now one value per
file.

It is ... each PCR gives one hash value per PCR and bank.  That's what
the file above is showing.  The hash values are 20 bytes for sha1, 32
bytes for sha256 and so on.

There was a question over whether the hash should be ascii as above
(hex representation) so human readable, or the 20/32/whatever binary
bytes of the hash.  I think we've got that resolved that ascii works.
