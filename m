There is also commit abd50b39e783 ("wait: introduce EXIT_TRACE to avoid
the racy EXIT_DEAD->EXIT_ZOMBIE transition").

Which I think is more of what I was remembering.

Right.

Frequently I have seen people do a cost/benefit analysis.

If the benefit is enough, and tracking down the userspace programs that
need to be verified to work with the change is inexpensive enough the
change is made.  Always keeping in mind that if something was missed and
the change causes a regression the change will need to be reverted.

If there is little benefit or the cost to track down userspace is great
enough the work is put in to hide the change from userspace.  Just
because it is too much trouble to expose it to userspace.

I honestly don't have any kind of sense about how hard it is to verify
that a userspace regression won't result from a change like this.  I
just know that the question needs to be asked.
