The struct rseq has an explicit alignment attribute of 32 bytes, which means
that even though we populate 20 bytes up to (including) the flags field, there is
implicitly 12 bytes or padding at the end of that structure. The size of the rseq_len
argument expected by the rseq system call since 4.18 is sizeof(struct rseq), which is
32 bytes (including the implicit padding).

So if we want to use the structure size as a way to indicate available features,
we need to explicitly express the padding field (12 bytes), and start using offsetofend()
on the following fields to allow per-field feature granularity without requiring
additional padding in the future.

If in the original rseq implementation we would have expected offsetofend() of the
flags fields as rseq_len, then we would not need those silly 12 bytes of padding,
but here we are.

It's vague in my memory, but I slightly recall aiming at using those 12-bytes of
padding for new feature extensions, in which case a version field would have helped.
But it appears we will very soon run out of space there and need to extend the
structure size anyway, so trying to re-purpose those 12 bytes might not be worth
the complexity.

Considering the userspace ABI exposed by glibc 2.35 (__rseq_offset, __rseq_size,
__rseq_flags), the "size" of the rseq structure becomes a really good fit for
available feature description across the entire ecosystem consisting of the kernel,
libc, and user applications. If we add a "version" field in there, then applications
would have to check yet one more thing in addition to the __rseq_size, which I
don't think is worthwhile.
