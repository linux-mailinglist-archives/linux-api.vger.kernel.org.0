Ah, you are talking about sys_exit hook; sorry, I thought you talked
about the exit() syscall.

I agree that the UP approach is better than the LAZY one if we have
per-server/per-cpu worker queues.

Let me spend some time and see if I can make all of this work together
beyond simple tests. With the upcoming holidays and some other things
I am busy with, this may take more than a week, I'm afraid...
