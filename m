I am unsure but it sounds like you are refuting your blocking_pool 
implementation. Nothing more and nothing less than the blocking_pool, just 
with a more modern and further analyzed DRNG is what was referenced as a TRNG.

Or maybe the terminology of TRNG (i.e. "true") is offending. I have no concern 
to have it replaced with some other terminology. Yet, I was just taking one 
well-defined term.

Yet, I fully agree that a noise source always must be vetted. This is what I 
tried with random.c in [1], specifically section 6.1 for x86 systems.

For my LRNG, I tried that in [2] section 3.2 compliant to SP800-90B. In order 
to provide a means to everybody to perform such entropy analysis, the entire 
tool set required for it is provided:

- with CONFIG_LRNG_TESTING providing an interface to the raw unconditioned 
noise

- with [3] providing a tool set to gather all data needed for an SP800-90B 
compliant quantitative analysis

Unfortunately due to license restrictions, I cannot make the same tool set 
available used for the quantiative study provided with [1] section 6.1.

Finally, to support the conclusions drawn from a noise source analysis, the 
health tests provided with LRNG compliant to SP800-90B are available with 
CONFIG_LRNG_HEALTH_TESTS. These tests help in identifying weak or broken noise 
sources.

It is fully clear that such studies of non-physical noise sources do not have 
a stochastical model which implies that we cannot make global statements. That 
is the limitation when using such noise sources. Though, the implementation 
should have sufficient "leeway" (i.e. underestmation) when crediting entropy 
to some events.

That is why I think that it is no bug when this interface can DoS other users 
wanting to access the very same resource. This is the price to pay for getting 
access to this type of data.

There are simply cryptographers who have use cases for such random numbers. 
The core use case is to seed other DRNGs and avoiding the chaining of free-
running DRNGs.

This is a common approach that you can see in action with the RDSEED 
instruction, for example.
