There are two conflicting requirements here:

1. Operations that release a resource must always succeed.
2. Failure with EINTR must not not have side effects.

The right conclusion is that operations that release resources must
not be able to fail with EINTR. And that's how POSIX should have
resolved the situation -- by getting rid of support for the silly
legacy synchronous-tape-drive-rewinding behavior of close on some
systems, and requiring close to succeed immediately with no waiting
for anything. But abandoning requirement 2 is not an option,
especially in light of the relationship between EINTR and thread
cancellation in regards to contract about side effects.

It's perfectly reasonable for implementations (as musl does, and as I
think glibc either does or intends to do) to just go all the way and
satisfy both 1 and 2 by having close translate the kernel EINTR into
0.

Unfortunately, regardless of what happens, code portable to old
systems needs to avoid getting in the situation to begin with. By
either not installing interrupting signal handlers or blocking EINTR
around close.

No, the job of the man pages absolutely is not "to tell people how to
program". It's to document behaviors. They are not a programming
tutorial. They are not polemic diatribes. They are unbiased statements
of facts. Facts of what the standards say and what implementations do,
that equip programmers with the knowledge they need to make their own
informed decisions, rather than blindly following what someone who
thinks they know better told them to do.

This would also be a desirable change, one I would support if other
implementors are on-board with pushing for it.

I will not accept that because it's a gross violation of the
responsibility of document writing.
