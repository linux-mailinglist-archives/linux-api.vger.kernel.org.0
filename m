The location of the file in the kernel tree has no bearing on if you use
a platform device, a USB device, or a PCI device.  It is just a location
of a file.

You are interacting with the perf api as the driver's primary userspace
api, so put the driver into the drivers/perf/ directory.  That's all
that Will is asking you to do here.
