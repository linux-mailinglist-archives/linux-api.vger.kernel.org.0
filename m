Sure and I get that, just not sure it'd be worth doing on the kernel
side for such (fairly) weak reasoning. The performance benefit is just a
side note in that if you did do it this way, you'd potentially be able
to run it more efficiently too. And regardless what people do or use
now, they are generally always interested in that aspect.

Writing that wrapper would be not even a screenful of code. Yes maybe
they don't know how to do it now, but it's _really_ trivial to do. It'd
take me roughly 1 min to do that, would be happy to help out with that
side so it could go into a commit or man page or whatever.

Pretty natural, I think. sendfile(2) predates that by quite a bit, and
the last real change to sendfile was using splice underneath. Which I
did, and that was probably almost 20 years ago at this point...

I do think it makes sense to have a sendfile that's both fast and
efficient, and can be used sanely with buffer reuse without relying on
odd heuristics.

My argument would be the same as for other features - if you can do it
simpler this other way, why not consider that? The end result would be
the same, you can do fast sendfile() with sane buffer reuse. But the
kernel side would be simpler, which is always a kernel main goal for
those of us that have to maintain it.

Just adding sendfile2() works in the sense that it's an easier drop in
replacement for an app, though the error queue side does mean it needs
to change anyway - it's not just replacing one syscall with another. And
if we want to be lazy, sure that's fine. I just don't think it's the
best way to do it when we literally have a mechanism that's designed for
this and works with reuse already with normal send zc (and receive side
too, in the next kernel).
