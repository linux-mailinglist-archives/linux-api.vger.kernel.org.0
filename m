To C/R applications that use /dev/vmgenid CRIU need to be aware of it.
Checkpointing and restoring withing the same "VM generation" shouldn't be
a problem, but IMHO, making restore work after genid bump could be
challenging.

Alex, what scenario involving CRIU did you have in mind?

Containers do not emulate ioctls but they can have /dev/vmgenid inside
the container, so applications can use it the same way as outside the
container.
