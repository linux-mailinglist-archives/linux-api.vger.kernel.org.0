In general, objects which are kept alive by name tend to be quite
awkward. Things like network namespaces essentially have to work that
way and end up with awkward APIs.  Things like shared memory don't
actually have to be kept alive by name, and the cases that do keep
them alive by name (tmpfs, shmget) can end up being so awkward that
people invent nameless variants like memfd.

So I would strongly suggest you see how the design works out with no
names and no external keep-alive mechanism.  Either have the continued
existence of *any* fd keep the whole thing alive or make it be a pair
of struct files, one that controls the region (and can map things into
it, etc) and one that can map it.  SCM_RIGHTS is pretty good for
passing objects like this around.
