Sometimes the notifications are not triggered when there is a conflict
when applying the patch from patchwork directly. I usually answer
manually in this case but I might have forgotten.

About the patch, I felt it was good enough for merging, and I want to
avoid applying such patches right before freezing our branches. Hence,
I tend to be more aggressive earlier in the release cycles because I
hate when my patches get delayed infinitely. The other side is a more
careful approach when -rc6 gets tagged so that I can drop anything which
would be crazily broken before our -next branches are stalled, leading
for an useless public revert. Of course, I am fully open to removing
this patch from -next if you ever feel it was too early and will
happily get rid of it for this release: we can move the patch for the
next release if you agree on this (especially since it touches the
ABI).

Cheers,
Miqu√®l
