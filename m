It's also passed with a set_tid_size argument so we'd know how large
set_tid is.

We can't really punt on this and should figure this out now. I've
pointed to this problem in my other mail as well.
Though I currently fail to see why this should be a huge problem to get
that working as long as each pointer comes with a known size.

If you have a size to it it should be ok? I'm probably missing
something.
