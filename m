Task was RUNNING, hits schedule() after passing through sys_enter().
this marks it BLOCKED. Task wakes again and proceeds to sys_exit(), at
which point it's marked RUNNABLE and put on the runnable list. After
which it'll kick the server to process said list.

No violation of anything there. The time between returning from
schedule() and sys_exit() is unmanaged.

sys_exit() is the spot where we regain control.

Well, that's *your* use-case. I'm fairly sure there's more people that
want to use this thing.

You can trivially create this, even if the underlying thing is
per-server. Simply have a lock and shared data structure between the
servers.

Even in the kernel, it should be mostly trivial to create a global
policy. The only tricky bit (in the kernel) is the whole affinity muck,
but userspace doesn't *need* to do even that.

So the way I'm seeing things is that the server *is* the 'CPU'. A UP
machine cannot rely on another CPU to make preemption happen.

Also, preemption is very much not about misbehaviour. Wakeup can cause a
preemption event if the woken task is deemed higher priority than the
current running one for example.

And time based preemption is definitely also a thing wrt resource
distribution.

This seems to discount pure computational workloads.

So I went with a UP first approach. I made single server preemption
driven scheduling work first (both tick and wakeup-preemption are
supported).

The whole LAZY thing is only meant to supress some of that (notably
wakeup preemption), but you're right in that it's not really nice. I got
it working, but I'm not particularly happy with it either.

Having the sys_enter/sys_exit hooks also made the page pins short lived,
and signals much simpler to handle. You're destroying signals IIUC.


So I see no fundamental reason why userspace cannot do something like:

	struct umcg_task *current = NULL;

	for (;;) {
		self->state = UMCG_TASK_RUNNABLE | UMCG_TF_COND_WAIT;

		runnable_ptr = (void *)__atomic_exchange_n(&self->runnable_workers_ptr,
                                                           NULL, __ATOMIC_SEQ_CST);

		pthread_mutex_lock(&global_queue.lock);
		while (runnable_ptr) {
			next = (void *)runnable_ptr->runnable_workers_ptr;
			enqueue_task(&global_queue, runnable_ptr);
			runnable_ptr = next;
		}

		/* complicated bit about current already running goes here */

		current = pick_task(&global_queue);
		self->next_tid = current ? current->tid : 0;
unlock:
		pthread_mutex_unlock(&global_queue.lock);

		ret = sys_umcg_wait(0, 0);

		pthread_mutex_lock(&global_queue.lock);
		/* umcg_wait() didn't switch, make sure to return the task */
		if (self->next_tid) {
			enqueue_task(&global_queue, current);
			current = NULL;
		}
		pthread_mutex_unlock(&global_queue.lock);

		// do something with @ret
	}

to get global scheduling and all the contention^Wgoodness related to it.
Except, of course, it's more complicated, but I think the idea's clear
enough.
