Not a native speaker, but is this missing a noun like "flag"?
"The CLONE_INTO_CGROUP {flag,feature} allows the [...]"?

Should this just be "opening a cgroup v2 directory" and not "directory
file"? Feels redundant.

I forgot to mention that spawning directly into a target cgroup is also
more efficient than moving it after creation. The specific reason is
mentioned in the commit message, the write lock of the semaphore need
not be taken in contrast to when it is moved afterwards. That
implementation details is not that interesting but it might be
interesting to know that it provides performance benefits in general.
