Hi Paul

I fully understand your argument. However, 'integrity' has been the
word to identify the integrity subsystem since long time ago.

Reducing the scope to 'ima' would create some confusion since, while
'ima' is associated to integrity, it would not encompass EVM.

The term 'integrity', although it is a property, it precisely
identifies in the kernel context the scope and goals of the subsystem,
and is general enough to encompass new projects going in a similar
direction (such as my integrity digest cache).

From a technical perspective, at the moment it is not possible to split
'integrity' in two standalone LSMs 'ima' and 'evm', as IMA and EVM work
on shared integrity metadata. Also my integrity digest cache is using
the same metadata.

In addition, making IMA and EVM as standalone LSMs would require a much
longer development cycle to make them use disjoint metadata and to
define proper communication interfaces. It would be not anymore a
technical move of function calls from a place to another, like for the
current patch set, but would require substantial time to validate the
new design.

To submit my patch set in the current state, the only thing I need is
to have LSM_ID_INTEGRITY defined.

Roberto
