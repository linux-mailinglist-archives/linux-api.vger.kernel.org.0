I think you are looking at an older version of POSIX (when what you 
say was true). In the POSIX.1-2008/SUSv4 specification of <errno.h>, 
we have:
[[
[ENOTSUP] Not supported (may be the same value as [EOPNOTSUPP]).
EOPNOTSUPP] Operation not supported on socket (may be the same value as
[ENOTSUP]).
]]

It's a mess of course. It looks like the usual reason: BSD vs
other historical implementations. BSD invented EOPNOTSUPP for
the sockets API (and you see this reflected in POSIX.1). Other
implementations (presumably System V) had ENOTSUP (which
is what appears in POSIX.1 for timer_create() and
clock_nanosleep()).

Actually, there are 0 mentions of ENOTSUP in the kernel
(other than in tools and samples). The constant that appears
in the kernel is one called ENOTSUPP (2 P's) defined as 524 
in include/linux/errno.h !! Yikes! What a mess!

And then EOPNOTSUPP defined with value 95 in the kernel file
include/uapi/asm-generic/errno.h (and with some architecture
variations as you note).

And then in glibc sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/bits/errno.h:

[[
/* Older Linux headers do not define these constants.  */
# ifndef ENOTSUP
#  define ENOTSUP               EOPNOTSUPP
# endif
]]

And in glibc EOPNOTSUPP is 95

I'm not sure we do need to pick one here. See POSIX, which uses
both. 

And see the definition of EOPNOTSUPP in POSIX. Arguably,
it is only for sockets, and everything else should be ENOTSUP.
(And for the most part, that's how things are done in the 
POSIX specifications of the APIs.)

In summary, I'm going to do nothing :-}. I checked
* the time/clock man pages; they use ENOTSUP (consistent with 
  POSIX)
* the pthreads man pages; they use ENOTSUP (consistent with POSIX)
* the sockets APIs man pages; they use EOPNOTSUPP (consistent 
  with POSIX)

The rest of the pages are a mixed bag (mostly not specified in
POSIX), and I don;t think there's any really clear fix.

Its okay -- don't feel any obligation here. You already contributed!
