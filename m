Subject: [PATCH v2 0/5] Introduce MADV_COLD and MADV_PAGEOUT

This patch is part of previous series:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20190531064313.193437-1-minchan@kernel.org/T/#u
Originally, it was created for external madvise hinting feature.

https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/5/31/463
Michal wanted to separte the discussion from external hinting interface
so this patchset includes only first part of my entire patchset

  - introduce MADV_COLD and MADV_PAGEOUT hint to madvise.

However, I keep entire description for others for easier understanding
why this kinds of hint was born.

Thanks.

This patchset is against on next-20190530.

Below is description of previous entire patchset.
================= &< =====================

- Background

The Android terminology used for forking a new process and starting an app
from scratch is a cold start, while resuming an existing app is a hot start.
While we continually try to improve the performance of cold starts, hot
starts will always be significantly less power hungry as well as faster so
we are trying to make hot start more likely than cold start.

To increase hot start, Android userspace manages the order that apps should
be killed in a process called ActivityManagerService. ActivityManagerService
tracks every Android app or service that the user could be interacting with
at any time and translates that into a ranked list for lmkd(low memory
killer daemon). They are likely to be killed by lmkd if the system has to
reclaim memory. In that sense they are similar to entries in any other cache.
Those apps are kept alive for opportunistic performance improvements but
those performance improvements will vary based on the memory requirements of
individual workloads.

- Problem

Naturally, cached apps were dominant consumers of memory on the system.
However, they were not significant consumers of swap even though they are
good candidate for swap. Under investigation, swapping out only begins
once the low zone watermark is hit and kswapd wakes up, but the overall
allocation rate in the system might trip lmkd thresholds and cause a cached
process to be killed(we measured performance swapping out vs. zapping the
memory by killing a process. Unsurprisingly, zapping is 10x times faster
even though we use zram which is much faster than real storage) so kill
from lmkd will often satisfy the high zone watermark, resulting in very
few pages actually being moved to swap.

- Approach

The approach we chose was to use a new interface to allow userspace to
proactively reclaim entire processes by leveraging platform information.
This allowed us to bypass the inaccuracy of the kernelâ€™s LRUs for pages
that are known to be cold from userspace and to avoid races with lmkd
by reclaiming apps as soon as they entered the cached state. Additionally,
it could provide many chances for platform to use much information to
optimize memory efficiency.

To achieve the goal, the patchset introduce two new options for madvise.
One is MADV_COLD which will deactivate activated pages and the other is
MADV_PAGEOUT which will reclaim private pages instantly. These new options
complement MADV_DONTNEED and MADV_FREE by adding non-destructive ways to
gain some free memory space. MADV_PAGEOUT is similar to MADV_DONTNEED in a way
that it hints the kernel that memory region is not currently needed and
should be reclaimed immediately; MADV_COLD is similar to MADV_FREE in a way
that it hints the kernel that memory region is not currently needed and
should be reclaimed when memory pressure rises.

This approach is similar in spirit to madvise(MADV_WONTNEED), but the
information required to make the reclaim decision is not known to the app.
Instead, it is known to a centralized userspace daemon, and that daemon
must be able to initiate reclaim on its own without any app involvement.
To solve the concern, this patch introduces new syscall -

    struct pr_madvise_param {
            int size;               /* the size of this structure */
            int cookie;             /* reserved to support atomicity */
            int nr_elem;            /* count of below arrary fields */
            int __user *hints;      /* hints for each range */
            /* to store result of each operation */
            const struct iovec __user *results;
            /* input address ranges */
            const struct iovec __user *ranges;
    };
    
    int process_madvise(int pidfd, struct pr_madvise_param *u_param,
                            unsigned long flags);

The syscall get pidfd to give hints to external process and provides
pair of result/ranges vector arguments so that it could give several
hints to each address range all at once. It also has cookie variable
to support atomicity of the API for address ranges operations. IOW, if
target process changes address space since monitor process has parsed
address ranges via map_files or maps, the API can detect the race so
could cancel entire address space operation. It's not implemented yet.
Daniel Colascione suggested a idea(Please read description in patch[6/6])
and this patchset adds cookie a variable for the future.

- Experiment

We did bunch of testing with several hundreds of real users, not artificial
benchmark on android. We saw about 17% cold start decreasement without any
significant battery/app startup latency issues. And with artificial benchmark
which launches and switching apps, we saw average 7% app launching improvement,
18% less lmkd kill and good stat from vmstat.

A is vanilla and B is process_madvise.

pgmajfault is increased by 173% because swapin is increased by 200% by
process_madvise hint. However, swap read based on zram is much cheaper
than file IO in performance point of view and app hot start by swapin is
also cheaper than cold start from the beginning of app which needs many IO
from storage and initialization steps.

Brian Geffon in ChromeOS team had an experiment with process_madvise(2)
Quote form him:
"What I found is that by using process_madvise after a tab has been back
grounded for more than 45 seconds reduced the average tab switch times by
25%! This is a huge result and very obvious validation that process_madvise
hints works well for the ChromeOS use case."

This patchset is against on next-20190607.
