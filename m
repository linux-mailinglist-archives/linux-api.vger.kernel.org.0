Hi Harold,

Let's divert into a few specifics to give some routes to implementing these.
Some of them are extensions of things already well handled.  Tweaks
and extensions in the 'spirit' of the existing spec are both places where
adding some richness to the spec is probably not too difficult and where
there may be some flexibility.

In some cases the definitions in the specification almost certainly
came after your design.

There is a general temperature monitoring and trip thresholds etc in the
spec via get Health Info and event logs. That covers a single value,
so not as extensive as what you refer to but it's a start. Whilst you
are right that the specification should not mandate N temperatures in
specific locations, it would be a reasonable request to allow for a
wider set of monitors with some level of description.  The intent
being that generic software can discover what is there and present
that info for logging / monitoring.
Whilst the exact meaning will vary by device, some broad scoping is
easy enough (memory controller vs various FRUs perhaps) and that is useful
to providing generic users space software.  hmwon has long handled this
sort of data from whole systems where very similar aspects of 'what does
this monitor actually mean' apply.  Sometimes that does need device
specific mapping files - so there is precedence that may be helpful here.

These two are somewhat related.

This selection falls into two broad categories.
- Opaque logging and reporting needed just for debug.  There are patches
  on list for Vendor Debug Log.  They haven't merged yet though I think,
  so good to get your input on that series.  Intent of that feature is
  opaque logs.  There will never be a useful general tool for that stuff,
  conversely no general userspace tools will use them as a result.
  It's likely vendor engineer only territory.

- Counters that useful at runtime.
  The CXL PMU spec is rich and flexible. In common with CPU PMUs the perf driver
  allows for direct specification of events to count. The same issue with
  implementation specific counters occurs in CPUs.  Whilst you can keep
  the meaning of events opaque, if you do you loose out on useable general
  purpose software (e.g. perftool).  Alternatively some of this can be
  pushed into perf tool description files. 
  The advantage of pushing counters in to the main specification is that
  they work out of the box as the CPMU driver will report those directly
  (no need for perf tool to work with raw event codes).
  At the moment that driver implements part of the CPMU spec. If there are
  features you need (free running counters come to mind) then shout
  / patches welcome.  We decided to play wait and see with the CPMU driver as
  it wasn't clear if the full flexibility was needed for real devices.

There are standard interfaces defined for some of this stuff as well.
Last I checked the discussion revolved around component state dump
only being safe to use if the background command abort was supported,
as that was needed to ensure the kernel was not locked out for an indefinite
amount of time.

If you are looking at other standards being run to configure CXL devices
excellent, but those standards should be accessed using whatever the
appropriate kernel interfaces.  Could you give some examples for this one?

Agreed - but those may need specific drivers.

Whilst I appreciate the way this can slow down adoption / kernel support
it's a path that is still worth it in the end.

As Dan and others have put it, there are other routes than the main
CXL standard. Those should allow tighter collaboration on smaller topics
to define common standards.
