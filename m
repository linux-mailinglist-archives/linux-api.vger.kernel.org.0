So how would you define read() in this format in a way that has not
already been attempted in the past?  How are you going to define a
format that explains functionality in a way that is not just the
implementation in the end?

The content is described in Documentation/ABI/ entries, where do you see
that missing?

And you are correct, that place does not describe syscalls, or other
user/kernel interfaces that predate sysfs.

good luck!
