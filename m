Are you referring to the possibility to DoS the scheduler by keep
writing cgroup attributes?

Because, in that case I think cgroup attributes could be written also by
non priv users. It all depends on how they are mounted and permissions
are set. Isn't it?

Anyway, I'm not sure we can fix that here... and in principle we could
have that DoS by setting CPUs affinities, which is user exposed.
Isn't it?

Yep, right... I think there was some more code in prev versions but I
forgot to get rid of that "goto" pattern after some change.
