But if rseq is managed by libc, it really has to use the full size
unconditionally.  I would even expect that eventually, the kernel only
supports the initial 32, maybe 64 for a few early extension, and the
size indicated by the auxiliary vector.

Not all of that area would be ABI, some of it would be used by the
vDSO only and opaque to userspace application (with applications/libcs
passing __rseq_offset as an argument to these functions).

Indeed.
