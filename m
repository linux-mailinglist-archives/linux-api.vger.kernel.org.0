Why?  I've never heard of such as a requirement and numerous drivers
provide fairly direct access to hardware. Sometimes there is a subsystem
aiding the data formatting etc, but fundamentally that's a convenience.

Taking this to a silly level, on this basis all networking drivers would
not be in the kernel.  They are there mainly to provide userspace access to
a network.  Any of the hardware access subsystems such hwmon, input, IIO
etc are primarily about providing a convenient way to get data to/from
a device.  They are kernel drivers because that is the cleaner path
for data marshaling, interrupt handling etc.

In kernel users are a perfectly valid reason to have a kernel driver,
but it's far from the only one.  None of the AI accelerators have in kernel
users today (maybe they will in future). Sure there are other arguments
that mean only a few such devices have been upstreamed, but it's not
that they need in kernel users. If it's really an issue I'll just submit
it to driver/misc and Greg can take a view on whether it's an acceptable
device to have driver for... (after he's asked the obvious question of
why aren't the CXL folk taking it!) +cc Greg to save providing info later.

For background this is a PCI function with a mailbox used for switch
configuration. The mailbox is identical to the one found on CXL type3
devices. Whole thing defined in the CXL spec. It gets a little complex
because you can tunnel commands to devices connected to the switch,
potentially affecting other hosts.  Typical Linux device doing this
would be a BMC, but there have been repeated questions about providing
a subset of access to any Linux system (avoiding the foot guns)
Whole thing fully discoverable - proposal is a standard PCI driver.

There are possibilities, but for now it's a transport driver just like
MCTP etc with a well defined chardev interface, with documented ioctl
interface etc (which I'd keep inline with one the CXL mailbox uses
just to avoid reinventing the wheel - I'd prefer to use that directly
to avoid divergence but I don't care that much).

As far as I can see, with the security / blast radius concern alleviated
by disabling this if lockdown is in use + taint for unaudited commands
(and a nasty sounding config similar to the cxl mailbox one)
there is little reason not to take such a driver into the kernel.
It has next to no maintenance impact outside of itself and a bit of
library code which I've proposed pushing down to the level of MMPT
(so PCI not CXL) if you think that is necessary. 

We want interrupt handling and basic access controls / command
interface to userspace.

Apologies if I'm grumpy - several long days of battling cpu hotplug code.
