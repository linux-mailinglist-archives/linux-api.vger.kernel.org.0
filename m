Hmmm, the point of the new syscall was **exactly** to avoid the 2^3
combinations above, and to provide developers only two, sane and easy,
options:

  - GRND2_INSECURE
  - GRND2_SECURE_UNBOUNDED_INITIAL_WAIT

You *must* pick one of these, and that's it. (!)

Then the proposed getrandom_wait(7) manpage, also mentioned in the V4
patch WARN message, would provide a big rationale, and encourage
everyone to use the new getrandom2(2) syscall instead.

But yeah, maybe we should add the extra flags to the old getrandom()
instead, and let glibc implement a getrandom_safe(3) wrapper only
with the sane options available.

Problem is, glibc is still *really* slow in adopting linux syscall
wrappers, so I'm not optimistic about that...

I still see the new system call as the sanest path, even provided
the cost of a new syscall number..

@Linus, @Ted:  Final thoughts?

Yeah, noticed that, but I've learned not to change crypto or
speculative-execution code even if the changes "just look the same" at
first glance ;-)

(out of curiosity, I'll do a quick test with this CRNG entropy reset
part removed. Maybe it was indeed part of the problem..)

Yeah, I would propose to keep the V4-submitted "timeout then WARN"
logic. This alone will give user-space / distributions time to adapt.

For example, it was interesting that even the 0day bot had limited
entropy on boot (virtio-rng / TRUST_CPU not enabled):

    https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20190920005120.GP15734@shao2-debian

If user-space didn't get its act together, then the other extreme
measures can be implemented later (the getrandom() length test, using
jitter as a credited kernel entropy source, etc., etc.)

Yup, that's what was in the submitted V4 patch too. The caller
explicitly asked for "insecure", so they know what they're doing.

getrandom2(2) never prints any kernel message.

ACK. I'll wait for an answer to the "Final thoughts?" question above,
send a V5 with CC:stable, then disappear from this thread ;-)

Thanks a lot everyone!
