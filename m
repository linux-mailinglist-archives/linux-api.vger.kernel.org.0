We already use clone.  I don't know why.  We should add a comment that
provides the reason.

I think what happens with these emulators that they use fork (no shared
address space) but suspend the parent thread.  clone with CLONE_VFORK
definitely does not fail.  That mostly works, except that you do not get
back the error code from the execve.  Instead, the process is considered
launched, and the caller collects the exit status from the _exit after
the failed execve.

As far as we understand the situation, we believe that we absolutely
must block all signals for both the parent thread and the new
subprocess.  Signals can be unblocked in the subprocess, but only after
setting their handlers to SIG_DFL or SIG_IGN.  (Parent signal handlers
cannot run in the subprocess because application-supplied signal
handlers generally do not expect to run with a corrupt TCBâ€”or a
different PID.)

At that point, I wonder if we can just skip the stack setup for the
CLONE_VFORK case and reuse the existing stack.

Thanks,
Florian
