OK, that's somewhat subtle and I hadn't gotten that either.

Currently it return -ETIMEDOUT in RUNNING state for both server and
worker callers.

Let me go fix that then.

I'm not sure I'm following. For this to be true A and C must be running
on a different server right?

So we have something like:

	S0 running A			S1 running B

Therefore:

	S0::state == RUNNABLE		S1::state == RUNNABLE
	A::server_tid == S0.tid		B::server_tid == S1.tid
	A::state == RUNNING		B::state == RUNNING

Now, you want A to switch to C, therefore C had better be with S0, eg we
have:

	C::server_tid == S0.tid
	C::state == RUNNABLE

So then A does:

	A::next_tid = C.tid;
	sys_umcg_wait();

Which will:

	pin(A);
	pin(S0);

	cmpxchg(A::state, RUNNING, RUNNABLE);

	next_tid = A::next_tid; // C

	enqueue(S0::runnable, A);

At which point B steals S0's runnable queue, and tries to make A go.

					runnable = xchg(S0::runnable_list_ptr, NULL); // == A
					A::server_tid = S1.tid;
					B::next_tid = A.tid;
					sys_umcg_wait();

	wake(C)
	  cmpxchg(C::state, RUNNABLE, RUNNING); <-- *fault*


Something like that, right?

What currently happens is that S0 goes back to S0 and S1 ends up in A.
That is, if, for any reason we fail to wake next_tid, we'll wake
server_tid.

So then S0 wakes up and gets to re-evaluate life. If it has another
worker it can go run that, otherwise it can try and steal a worker
somewhere or just idle out.

Now arguably, the only reason A->C can fault is because C is garbage, at
which point your program is malformed and it doesn't matter what
happens one way or the other.
