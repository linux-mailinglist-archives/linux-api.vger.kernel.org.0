Sorry if I sound annoying, but it's a matter of terminology and needs.

Cryptograhically random means safe for use with cryptography in that it
is unguessable enough so that you can use it for encryption keys that
nobody will be able to guess. It in no ways guarantees uniqueness, just
like you don't really care if the symmetric crypto key of you VPN has
already been used once somewhere else as long as there's no way to know.
However with the good enough distribution that a CSPRNG provides,
collisions within a *same* generator are bound to a very low, predictable
rate which is by generally considered as acceptable for all use cases.

Something random (cryptographically or not) *cannot* be unique by
definition, otherwise it's not random anymore, since each draw has an
influence on the remaining list of possible draws, which is contrary to
randomness. And conversely something unique cannot be completely random
because if you know it's unique, you can already rule out all other known
values from the candidates, thus it's more predictable than random.

With this in mind, picking randoms from a same RNG is often highly
sufficient to consider they're highly likely unique within a long
period. But it's not a guarantee. And it's even less one between two
RNGs (e.g. if uniqueness is required between multiple hypervisors in
case VMs are migrated or centrally managed, which I don't know).

If what is sought here is a strong guarantee of uniqueness, using a
counter as you first suggested is better. If what is sought is pure
randomness (in the sense that it's unpredictable, which I don't think
is needed here), then randoms are better. If both are required, just
concatenate a counter and a random. And if you need them to be spatially
unique, just include a node identifier.

Now the initial needs in the forwarded message are not entirely clear
to me but I wanted to rule out the apparent mismatch between the expressed
needs for uniqueness and the proposed solutions solely based on randomness.

Cheers,
Willy
