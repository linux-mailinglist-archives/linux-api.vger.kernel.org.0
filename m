I do not really care strongly. I am pretty sure we will have a lot of
suggestions because people tend to be good at arguing about that...
Anyway, unlike DONTNEED/FREE we do not have any other OS to implement
these features, right? So we shouldn't be tight to existing names.
On the other hand I kinda like the reference to the existing names but
DEACTIVATE/PAGEOUT seem a good fit to me as well. Unless there is way
much better name suggested I would go with one of those. Up to you.
