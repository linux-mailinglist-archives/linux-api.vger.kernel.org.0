Considering that the same "node id" is shared across various cores, I don't expect
it to be of much use in a rseq critical section comparison. That differs from the
"cpu id" (really the core ID), or the eventual concept of "vcpu id" as developed
internally at Google, which are identifiers which are guaranteed to be unique
within a process, and unchanged, for the duration of the rseq critical section.

Also, having these node_id* fields after the original end of the struct rseq
means user-space would have to check whether the glibc's __rseq_size is large
enough to contain those node_id* fields before loading them, which means there
needs to be at least one comparison before using the fields, therefore defeating
the purpose of the "*_id_start" trick.

So for those two reasons, I think just the "node_id" field would be sufficient
(no node_id_start field).

This brings another question though: should we then place the "node_id" field
in the original struct rseq padding or after ?

If we place it in the original padding, then glibc-2.35 would have enough
space to contain this field, but we would need to add a new sys_rseq flag to
query whether the node_id field is supported by the kernel, for use by
applications and glibc.

However, if we choose to place the new node_id field after the original
padding, applications can simply check with the __rseq_size exposed by
glibc to detect whether this field is there and populated. I have a
preference for this last approach as this looks less like a "one-off"
hack, and a more future-proof way to extend struct rseq.

Thoughts ?

Thanks,

Mathieu
