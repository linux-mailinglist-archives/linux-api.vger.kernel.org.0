@Christian Brauner,
Regarding 0 case I guess it is fine.
Just to cross check, I used my test program to run with some other
kernel (where there are no changes to sysinfo).
I see that the field returns 0.
# ./test-sysinfo.out
Total RAM: 249320 kB
Free RAM: 233416 kB
Avail RAM: 0 kB

And this is fine and this is also good.
This also indicates 2 things:
a) Either "availram" field is not available in this kernel version
(less than 5.1x)
==> Thus it should fall back to parsing MemAvailable from /proc/meminfo
b) Or, MemAvailable field itself is not available (less than 3.1x)

I will push the new patch set now..

Thanks all!
Pintu
