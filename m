Continuing the conversation about the above commit and adding Jesse.
I was trying to understand the problem that the commit message explains
"The default behavior of the kernel is somewhat undesirable as all
requested interrupts end up on CPU0 after registration.", I have also been
trying to reproduce this behavior without the patch but I failed in doing
so, maybe because I am missing something here.

@Jesse Can you please explain? FWIU IRQ affinity should be decided based on
the default affinity mask.

The problem with the commit is that when we overwrite the affinity mask
based on the hinting mask we completely ignore the default SMP affinity
mask. If we do want to overwrite the affinity based on the hint mask we
should atleast consider the default SMP affinity.
