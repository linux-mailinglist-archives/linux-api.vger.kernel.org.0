Affinity masks and _SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF can be off by more than an
order of magnitude compared to the cgroup cpuset, I think, and those
aren't even that atypical configurations.

The number of concurrent threads sounds more tractable, but I'm
worried about things creating threads behind libc's back (perhaps
io_uring?).  So it couldn't be a hard upper bound.

I'm worried about querying anything cgroup-related because these APIs
have a reputation for being slow, convoluted, and unstable
(effectively not subject to the “don't break userspace” rule).
Hopefully I'm wrong about that.

There are container hosts out there that synthesize an affinity mask
that matches the CPU allocation, assuming that anyone who calls
sched_getaffinity only does so for counting the number of set bits.

Sounds reasonable.

Due to the alignment, I think you'd only ever see 32 and 64 bytes for
now?

I'd appreciate if you could put the maximm supported size and possibly
the alignment in the auxiliary vector, so that we don't have to rseq
system calls in a loop on process startup.
