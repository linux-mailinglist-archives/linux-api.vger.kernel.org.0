I suspect that any approach based on a user-space cache will break with
respect to CRIU. That is one big advantage of using the rseq thread area
for this.

As stated in my self-reply, I don't think those two fields are needed
after all.

True. However considering that we plan to remove the buggy "rseq_cs.ptr"
fields from the API, that rseq.h UAPI compatibility does not seem to be
very much relevant.

But still, it's better if we can avoid breaking API, agreed. And the
"node_id_start" does not appear to be needed after all.

Thanks,

Mathieu
