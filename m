Ah, great! Here comes the advert.. :)

  make -C tools/net/ynl/

will generate the C lib for you. tools/net/ynl/generated/netdev-user.h
will have the full API. There are some samples in
tools/net/ynl/samples/. And basic info also here:
https://docs.kernel.org/next/userspace-api/netlink/intro-specs.html#ynl-lib

You should be able to convert Sridhar's cli.py into an equivalent 
in C in ~10 LoC.

Nothing wrong with it in particular, but we went with the netlink API
because all the objects are related. There are interrupts, NAPI
instances, queues, page pools etc. and we need to show all sort of
attributes, capabilities, stats as well as the linking. So getsockopts
may not scale, or we'd need to create a monster mux getsockopt?
Plus with some luck the netlink API will send you notifications of
things changing.

Did you see SO_PREFER_BUSY_POLL by any chance? (In combination with
gro_flush_timeout IIRC). We added it a while back with Bjorn, it seems
like a great idea to me at the time but I'm unclear if anyone uses it 
in production..

FWIW if the driver you're using annotates things right you'll also get
the NAPI <> IRQ mapping via the netdev netlink. Hopefully that
simplifies the pinning setup.

Sounds very sensible & neat indeed. And makes sense to describe this 
in the docs, that should hopefully put more people on the right path :)

Interesting!
