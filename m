How can a blocked task hit sys_exit()? Shouldn't it be RUNNING?

Anyway, servers and workers are supposed to unregister before exiting,
so if they call sys_exit() they break the agreement; in my patch I
just clear all umcg-related state and proceed, without waking the
server: the user broke the protocol, let them figure out what
happened:

+static void umcg_clear_task(struct task_struct *tsk)
+{
+ /*
+ * This is either called for the current task, or for a newly forked
+ * task that is not yet running, so we don't need strict atomicity
+ * below.
+ */
+ if (tsk->umcg_task) {
+ WRITE_ONCE(tsk->umcg_task, NULL);
+
+ /* These can be simple writes - see the comment above. */
+ tsk->pinned_umcg_worker_page = NULL;
+ tsk->pinned_umcg_server_page = NULL;
+ tsk->flags &= ~PF_UMCG_WORKER;
+ }
+}
+
+/* Called both by normally (unregister) and abnormally exiting workers. */
+void umcg_handle_exiting_worker(void)
+{
+ umcg_unpin_pages();
+ umcg_clear_task(current);
+}

Yes, this is the model I have, as I outlined in another email. I
understand that having queues per-CPU/per-server is how it is done in
the kernel, both for historical reasons (before multiprocessing there
was a single queue/cpu) and for throughput (per-cpu runqueues are
individually faster than a global one). However, this model is known
to lag in presence of load spikes (long per-cpu queues with some CPUs
idle), and is not really easy to work with given the use cases this
whole userspace scheduling effort is trying to address: multiple
priorities and work isolation: these are easy to address directly with
a scheduler that has a global view rather than multiple
per-cpu/per-server schedulers/queues that try to coordinate.

I can even claim (without proof, just a hunch, based on how I would
code this) that strict scheduling policies around priority and
isolation (e.g. never run work item A if work item B becomes runnable,
unless work item A is already running) cannot be enforced without a
global scheduler, so per-cpu/per-server queues do not really fit the
use case here...

If all servers are busy running workers, then it is not up to the
kernel to "preempt" them in my model: the userspace can set up another
thread/task to preempt a misbehaving worker, which will wake the
server attached to it. But in practice there are always workers
blocking in the kernel, which wakes their servers, which then reap the
woken/runnable workers list, so well-behaving code does not need this.
Yes, sometimes the code does not behave well, e.g. a worker grabs a
spinlock, blocks in the kernel, its server runs another worker that
starts spinning on the spinlock; but this is fixable by making the
spinlock aware of our stuff: either the worker who got the lock is
marked as LOCKED and so does not release its server (one of the
reasons I have this flag), or the lock itself becomes sleepable (e.g.
after spinning a bit it calls into a futex wait).

And so we need to figure out this high-level thing first: do we go
with the per-server worker queues/lists, or do we go with the approach
I use in my patchset? It seems to me that the kernel-side code in my
patchset is not more complicated than your patchset is shaping up to
be, and some things are actually easier to accomplish, like having a
single idle_server_ptr vs this LAZY and/or server "preemption"
behavior that you have.

Again, I'm OK with having it your way if all needed features are
covered, but I think we should be explicit about why
per-server/per-cpu model is chosen vs the one I proposed, especially
as it seems the kernel side code is not really simpler in the end.
