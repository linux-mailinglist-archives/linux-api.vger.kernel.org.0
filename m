I may have misunderstood something in that dicussion then, because it
would definitely be a concern. It's OK for a process to be able to mess
up the state of any object that it has an NT handle to, but it shouldn't
be possible to mess up the state of unrelated objects in other processes
simply by passing the wrong integer id.

The concern is not so much about a malicious process going out of its
way to corrupt others, because it could do that through the NT API just
as well. But if a wayward pointer corrupts the client-side handle cache,
that shouldn't take down the entire session.
