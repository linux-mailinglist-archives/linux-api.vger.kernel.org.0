+FME is always accessed through the physical function (PF).
+
+Ports (and related AFUs) are accessed via PF by default, but could be exposed
+through virtual function (VF) devices via PCIe SRIOV. Each VF only contains
+1 Port and 1 AFU for isolation. Users could assign individual VFs (accelerators)
+created via PCIe SRIOV interface, to virtual machines.
+

+FPGA PCIe device driver is always loaded first once a FPGA PCIe PF or VF device
+is detected. It:
+
+	a) finish enumeration on both FPGA PCIe PF and VF device using common
+	   interfaces from DFL framework.
+	b) supports SRIOV.
+
+The FME device driver plays a management role in this driver architecture, it
+provides ioctls to release Port from PF and assign Port to PF. After release
+a port from PF, then it's safe to expose this port through a VF via PCIe SRIOV
+sysfs interface.
+
+To enable accessing an accelerator from applications running in a VM, the
+respective AFU's port needs to be assigned to a VF using the following steps:
+
+	a) The PF owns all AFU ports by default. Any port that needs to be
+	   reassigned to a VF must first be released through the
+	   DFL_FPGA_FME_PORT_RELEASE ioctl on the FME device.
+
+	b) Once N ports are released from PF, then user can use command below
+	   to enable SRIOV and VFs. Each VF owns only one Port with AFU.
+
+	   echo N > $PCI_DEVICE_PATH/sriov_numvfs
+
+	c) Pass through the VFs to VMs
+
+	d) The AFU under VF is accessible from applications in VM (using the
+	   same driver inside the VF).
+
+Note that an FME can't be assigned to a VF, thus PR and other management
+functions are only available via the PF.
