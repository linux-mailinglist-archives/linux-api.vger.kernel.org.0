Yes, this is my main intent.

That's a good questions. What should we do in those three situations 
when trying to grab the lock:

1) Lock has no owner

We probably want to simply grab the lock with an atomic instruction. But 
then if other threads are queued on sys_futex and did not manage to grab 
the lock yet, this would be detrimental to fairness.

2) Lock owner is running:

The lock owner is certainly running on another cpu (I'm using the term 
"cpu" here as logical cpu).

I guess we could either decide to bypass sys_futex entirely and try to 
grab the lock with an atomic, or we go through sys_futex nevertheless to 
allow futex to guarantee some fairness across threads.

3) Lock owner is sleeping:

The lock owner may be either tied to the same cpu as the requester, or a 
different cpu. Here calling FUTEX_WAIT and friends is pretty much required.

Can you elaborate on why skipping sys_futex in scenario (2) would be so 
bad ? I wonder if we could get away with skipping futex entirely in this 
scenario and still guarantee fairness by implementing MCS locking or 
ticket locks in userspace. Basically, if userspace queues itself on the 
lock through either MCS locking or ticket locks, it could guarantee 
fairness on its own.

Of course things are more complicated with PI-futex, is that what you 
have in mind ?

That's good input, thanks! I mostly defer to André Almeida on the 
use-case motivation. I mostly provided this POC patch to show that it 
_can_ be done with sys_rseq(2).

Thanks!
