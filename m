But have a signed bootloader? Which releases?

Because having the ability to do port io allows you to tamper with the 
running kernel and disable all the other security boundaries, making 
them pointless. Many PCI devices have a port IO side channel into MMIO 
BARs for use in early boot, so if an attacker can fill that BAR as they 
wish and then modify the BAR to map it into the kernel address space 
(and fix up the bridges appropriately), or if the port IO interface can 
be used to trigger DMA, the outcomes are pretty bad. The point of 
lockdown is to disable every plausible interface for userland (even uid 
0) to have access to any interfaces that would let them insert modified 
code into ring 0 - port IO is definitely one of those interfaces. An 
attacker could just take a kernel that allows ioperm(), add an initramfs 
containing their payload, boot, hotpatch the kernel to disable lockdown, 
and then kexec into their backdoored payload.

Sounds good.
