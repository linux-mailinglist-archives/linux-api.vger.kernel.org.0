So hooking init_module() is at the wrong layer -- for that to work, the container's /sbin/modprobe needs to already have figured out that the desired module is wireguard and have a .ko for it.

You can't use the container's .ko module. For this you would need to
trust the image that the container wants you to load. The container
manager should always load a host module.

I don't see this is a big issue because that is fairly trivial.
I think we never want to trust the container's modules.
What probably should be happening is that the manager exposes a list of
modules the container can request in some form. We have precedence for
doing something like this.
So now modprobe and similar tools can be made aware that if they are in
a container they should request that module from the container manager
be it via a socket request or something else.
Nesting will be a bit funny but can probably be made to work by just
bind-mounting the outermost socket into the container or relaying the
request.
