I see it as: does it actually make sense to expose a new state? All the
information this is conveying is: "this task took a lock that is
substituted by a sleepable lock under PREEMPT_RT". Now that you brought
this up, I don't really see much value in this vs just conveying that the
task is sleeping on a lock, i.e. just report the same as if it had gone
through rt_mutex_lock(), aka:
