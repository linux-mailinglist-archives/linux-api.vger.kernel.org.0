After giving all this some more thoughts, I think we can extend struct rseq
cleanly without adding any "padding1" fields at the end of the existing str=
ucture
(which would be effectively wasting very useful hot cache line space).

Here is what I have in mind:

We consider separately the "size" and the "feature_size" of the rseq struct=
ure.

- The "size" is really the size for memory allocation (includes padding),
- The "feature_size" is the offset after the last supported feature field.

So for the original struct rseq, size=3D32 bytes and feature_size=3D20 byte=
s
(offsetofend(struct rseq, flags)).

The kernel can expose this "supported rseq feature size" value through the =
ELF auxiliary
vector (with a new AT_RSEQ_FEATURE_SIZE). It would also expose a new AT_RSE=
Q_ALIGN for the
minimal allocation alignment required by the kernel. Those can be queried b=
y user-space
through getauxval(3).

glibc can add a new const unsigned int __rseq_feature_size symbol in a futu=
re release which
will support extended rseq structures. This is the symbol I expect rseq use=
rs to check
at least once in the program's lifetime before they try to access rseq fiel=
ds beyond
the originally populated 20 bytes.

The rseq_len argument passed to sys_rseq would really be the allocated size=
 for the rseq
area (as it is today, considering that the kernel expects sizeof(struct rse=
q)). Typically,
I would expect glibc to take the rseq feature_size value and round it up to=
 a value which
is a multiple of the AT_RSEQ_ALIGN. That allocation size would be used to p=
opulate
__rseq_size.

Am I missing something ?

Thanks,

Mathieu
