I'm not convinced that any complexity at all beyond using individual
files is needed for granular permission handling.  Unless something
actually needs permission bits on different files pointing at the same
sync object (which I believe NT supports, but it's sort of an odd
concept and I'm not immediately convinced that anything uses it),
merely having individual files ought to do the trick.  Handling of who
has permission to open a given named object can live in a daemon, and
I'd guess that Wine even already implements this.

And keeping everything together gives me flashbacks of Windows 95 and
Mac OS pre-X.  Sure, in principle the software wasn't malicious, but
there was no shortage whatsoever of buggy crap out there, and systems
were quite unstable.  Even just:

CreateSemaphore();
fork();
sleep a few seconds;
exit();

seems like it could corrupt the shared namespace world.  (Obviously no
one would ever do that, right?)

Also, handle leaks:

while(true) {
  make a subprocess, which creates a semaphore and crashes;
}

Years ago there was some discussion of making struct file
lighter-weight for light-weight things that aren't files.  And, in any
case, even the little integer indices in your code aren't free -- they
just aren't accounted as files.

And struct file isn't *that* bad.  I bet it's not dramatically bigger,
or even smaller, than whatever the Windows kernel stores for a
semaphore handle.
