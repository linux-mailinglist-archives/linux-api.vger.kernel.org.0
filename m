As Peter mentioned, though, we solely use the flat vcpu ID implementation.

In general, TCMalloc addresses sparseness by lazily allocating caches.
Virtual address space is relatively inexpensive, so we can allocate
enough space to have cache space for every feasible CPU ID and
structure things so on fault (of a zero page), we trigger the slow
path and handle initialization
(https://github.com/google/tcmalloc/blob/master/tcmalloc/cpu_cache.h#L824).

Even without virtual CPU IDs, TCMalloc still preferred to allocate a
cache per possible core, so no additional checks would be needed on
the fast path.

This is the strategy I looked at using previously.

Interesting.  It seems like this simplifies the fast path for using
the NUMA ID quite a bit.

As Peter mentions, our implementation prefers lower indexed vCPU IDs
over higher ones, but TCMalloc is agnostic to the precise IDs in use
(it looks at individual cache stats, not IDs, to make decisions).
Definitively skipping a vCPU ID on one node because it is used on
another seems entirely workable.
