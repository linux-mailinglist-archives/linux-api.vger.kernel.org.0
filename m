The point is that a VMA is how the MM connects its parts together,
cloning the content of a VMA without the rest of the VMA meta-data is
just going to be very fragile in the long run.. 

Especially if the VMA is presented as a normal VMA with working struct
pages/etc, not a pfn map.

The mirror would have to reclone the source VMA every time the source
VMA changes.

This seems really sketchy, get_user_pages is sensitive to the VMA,
what happens when VMA flags are different/etc?
