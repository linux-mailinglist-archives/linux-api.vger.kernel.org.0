Hi!

I've seen you send a new version based on this, but I figured I ought to
reply to this first.

Ufff.. good one. No #PF doesn't pass through sys_enter, I'll have to go
fix that.

Well, in general I would not call userspace bounded. There's plenty
userspace that doesn't do syscalls for indeterminate amounts of time.
Now, such userspace might not be the immediate target for UMCG, but we
also should not rule it out.

Having been an mm/ developer in a previous lifetime, I still think
page-pins should be as short as possible. They can get in the way of
other things, like CMA.

I'll go fix the non syscall things that can schedule.

Fair enough; can easily mark the task __set_current_state(TASK_RUNNING)
right near pagefault_enable() or something.

Yes, but you also completely wrecked signals afaict. But yes, this
preemption thing also causes that, which is why I proposed that LAZY
crud earlier, but I never got that in a shape I was happy with -- it
quickly becomes a mess :/

Right, there is some unmanaged time anyway.

I think this was already true, the servers could be running and all
workers could be woken from their in-kernel slumber, entering unmamanged
time, seeing N+M running tasks as worst possible case.

But yes, the 2N case is more common now.

So one of the things I've started, but didn't finished, is to forward
port the Proxy-Execution patches to a current kernel and play with the
PE+UMCG interaction.

Thinking about that interaction I've ran into that exact problem.

The 'nice' solution is to actually block the worker, but that's also the
slow solution :/

The other solution seems to be to keep kernel state; track the current
worker associated with the server. I haven't (so far) done that due to
my futex trauma.

So yes, the current API can be used to do the wrong thing, but the
kernel doesn't care and you get to keep the pieces in userspace. And I
much prefer user pieces over kernel pieces.

We agree, I'll update the comment.

I don't understand worker timeout, also see:

Why? Userspace can do umcg_ctl() if they want, no?

Yes, I think I've done that at least once, but clearly it didn't stick.

Ah, here it is:

  https://lkml.kernel.org/r/Ybm+HJzkO%2F0BB4Va@hirez.programming.kicks-ass.net

but since that LAZY thing didn't live that cleanup seems to have gone
out the window too.

Can also be -EAGAIN if the target task isn't in an expected state.

I also wanted to avoid DIE from the syscalls(). DIE really isn't nice,
we shouldn't do it if it can be avoided.

I really don't understand timeouts on workers, see above.

TF_PREEMPT must only be set on RUNNING, but if we're in wait, we're
RUNNABLE.

Bah, I should've written a better comment, because I can't quite
remember the case I had in mind. Also, again from the LAZY patch, I
think we can actually do better in some of the cases here.

Specifically, currently we'll enqueue on ::runnable_workers_ptr and fail
waking ::next_tid and leave it at that. While I think waking
::server_tid in that case makes sense.

I'll go prod at this.

Well, you had CLOCK_REALTIME, which I think is quite daft, but Thomas
also wanted CLOCK_TAI, so here we are.

I'll add the comment.

Yeah, you overloaded TIF_NOTIFY_RESUME, I prefer an explicit flag. And
the syscall things already have their own flag word, so that simply
needs another one.

Signals; server could be blocked in sys_umcg_wait() and get a signal,
then we should resume waiting after the signal.

I hate signals as much as the next guy, but we gotta do something with
them.

Anyway, let me go poke at this code again..
