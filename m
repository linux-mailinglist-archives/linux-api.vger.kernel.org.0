I don't know about any attempts at doing this in the past (other than
what's already been mentioned in this thread - e.g. SYSCALL_DEFINE),
what do you have in mind?

Lots of information can be expressed just with more specific types on
the function signature, even with regular C types.  No need to expose
the implementation in any way.

For example, accept4's signature is:

SYSCALL_DEFINE4(accept4, int, fd, struct sockaddr __user *, upeer_sockaddr,
		int __user *, upeer_addrlen, int, flags)

Here, fd and flags are the same type and have nothing to distinguish
them.  But, purely as an example, not suggesting exactly this, but one
could have:

typedef int user_fd_t;
typedef int accept_flags_t;

SYSCALL_DEFINE4(accept4, user_fd_t, fd, struct sockaddr __user *, upeer_sockaddr,
		int __user *, upeer_addrlen, accept_flags_t, flags)

Then a user could parse this SYSCALL_DEFINE and know that fd and flags
have different types with different possible valid values. user_fd_t
would be used by many different syscalls, accept_flags_t just by this.

With just this, the user of this information would still need to know
what user_fd and accept_flags are.  The next step would be describing
the valid values for accept_flags.  Unfortunately that's not something
that the C type system alone can express, but again purely as an
example, but one could have something like:

FLAGS_DEFINE(accept_flags, int,
  SOCK_CLOEXEC,
  SOCK_NONBLOCK)

Then a user could parse this FLAGS_DEFINE and know what the range of
valid values for accept_flags_t is.  This could also be used in the
kernel; for example, FLAGS_DEFINE could generate an accept_flags_valid
function, usable in accept4 as:

if (!accept_flags_valid(flags))
	return -EINVAL;

As for describing the buffer-writing behavior of read like I mentioned
before, here's a sketch of what that maybe could look like.  The current
signature of read is:

SYSCALL_DEFINE3(read, unsigned int, fd, char __user *, buf, size_t, count)

One could imagine adding a type to the return value and changing this to
something like:

#define bytes_written_or_error(written_buffer) int
#define writable_user_buf(size_of_buffer) char __user *

SYSCALL_DEFINE3_RET(bytes_written_or_error(buf),
                    read, unsigned int, fd,
                    writable_user_buf(count), buf, size_t, count)

A user could parse this and know at least partially how read uses the
passed-in buffer, without having to look at the implementation.

Just for the sake of mentioning it, one could also imagine static
analysis which checks the kernel implementation against these
more-detailed types, which could catch bugs.  But I'm not necessarily
proposing doing that - this is useful on its own even if it's not
checked by static analysis.

I meant that it doesn't describe the content of the APIs in a
machine-readable way.  (It's still very useful of course!)

Thank you!
