Just for your information: I played with that already as seen in [1] which 
does not require any kernel change.

The only issue that is currently there are the two races noted in [1]. These 
races seem to be only addressable when the reseeding and the gathering of 
random numbers are atomic. I was toying with the idea that the RNDRESEEDCRNG 
allows the user to specify an output buffer which would be filled in an atomic 
operation when the reseed is invoked. That buffer should only be at most in 
size of the security strength of the DRNG.
