How does this differ from /proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id?

Does the VM generation ID change in a running that effectively things it

Earlier it was a UUID now it is 32bit number?

Should this be a hotplug even rather than a new character device?

Without plugging into udev and the rest of the hotplug infrastructure
I suspect things will be missed.
