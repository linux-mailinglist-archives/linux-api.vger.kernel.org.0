Hi Will

Thanks a lot for the review! :)

Hm.. one possible way is to create a platform device, and introduce a new
platform device driver under drivers/perf/.

Sure. as it's not intel only, so will use "fpga_dfl_fme" or "dfl_fme" instead.

Oh.. then we can't just always return CPU0 for cpumask, have to switch
to another available cpu. Will add code to handle this case in the next
version. Thanks!

64bit counter may increase and carry out of bit31 between 2-32bit reads,
we probably need some more code (add extra reads?) to handle this case.


Thanks again for these valuable comments, will try to fix all of them in
the next version. : )
