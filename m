&gt; &gt; This is fine - there is some work to do, but the switch-cci PCI d=
river<br>
&gt; &gt; will hopefully be ready for upstream merge soon. There is no filt=
ering of<br>
&gt; &gt; accesses. Think of this as similar to all the damage you can do v=
ia<br>
&gt; &gt; MCTP from a BMC. Similarly it is likely that much of the complexi=
ty<br>
&gt; &gt; of the actual commands will be left to user space tooling: <br>

&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; Whether Kconfig help text is strong enough to ensure this only ge=
ts<br>

ss<br>
&gt; &gt; alongside an updated patch set.=C2=A0 <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; It is not clear to me that this material makes sense to house in<br>
&gt; drivers/ vs tools/ or even out-of-tree just for maintenance burden<br>
&gt; relief of keeping the universes separated. What does the Linux kernel<=
br>
&gt; project get out of carrying this in mainline alongside the inband code=
?<br>
<br>
I&#39;m not sure what you mean by in band.=C2=A0 Aim here was to discuss<br=
>
in-band drivers for switch CCI etc. Same reason from a kernel point of<br>
view for why we include embedded drivers.=C2=A0 I&#39;ll interpret in band<=
br>
as host driven and not inband as FM-API stuff.<br>
<br>
&gt; I do think the mailbox refactoring to support non-CXL use cases is<br>
&gt; interesting, but only so far as refactoring is consumed for inband use=
<br>
&gt; cases like RAS API.<br>
<br>
If I read this right, I disagree with the &#39;only so far&#39; bit.<br>
<br>
In all substantial ways we should support BMC use case of the Linux Kernel<=
br>
at a similar level to how we support forms of Linux Distros.=C2=A0 It may<b=
r>
not be our target market as developers for particular parts of our companie=
s,<br>
but we should not block those who want to support it.<br>
<br>
We should support them in drivers/ - maybe with example userspace code<br>
in tools.=C2=A0 Linux distros on BMCs is a big market, there are a number<b=
r>
of different distros using (and in some cases contributing to) the<br>
upstream kernel. Not everyone is using openBMC so there is not one<br>
common place where downstream patches could be carried.<br>
From a personal point of view, I like that for the same reasons that<br>
I like there being multiple Linux sever focused distros. It&#39;s a sign<br=

of a healthy ecosystem to have diverse options taking the mainline<br>
kernel as their starting point.<br>
<br>
BMCs are just another embedded market, and like other embedded markets<br>
we want to encourage upstream first etc. <br>
openBMC has a policy on this:<br>
<a href=3D"https://github.com/openbmc/docs/blob/master/kernel-development.m=
d" rel=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">https://github.com/openbmc/docs/blo=
b/master/kernel-development.md</a><br>
&quot;The OpenBMC project maintains a kernel tree for use by the project.<b=
r>
The tree&#39;s general development policy is that code must be upstream<br>
first.&quot; There are paths to bypass that for openBMC so it&#39;s a littl=
e<br>
more relaxed than some enterprise distros (today, their policies used<br>
to look very similar to this) but we should not be telling<br>
them they need to carry support downstream.=C2=A0 If we are<br>
going to tell them that, we need to be able to point at a major<br>
sticking point for maintenance burden.=C2=A0 So far I don&#39;t see the<br>
additional complexity as remotely close reaching that bar.<br>
<br>
So I think we do want switch-cci support and for that matter the equivalent=
<br>
for MHDs in the upstream kernel.<br>
<br>
One place I think there is some wiggle room is the taint on use of raw<br>
commands.=C2=A0 Leaving removal of that for BMC kernels as a patch they nee=
d<br>
to carry downstream doesn&#39;t seem too burdensome. I&#39;m sure they&#39;=
ll push<br>
back if it is a problem for them!=C2=A0 So I think we can kick that questio=
n<br>
into the future.<br>
<br>
Addressing maintenance burden, there is a question of where we split<br>
the stack.=C2=A0 Ignore MHDs for now (I won&#39;t go into why in this forum=
...)<br>
<br>
The current proposal is (simplified to ignore some sharing in lookup code e=
tc<br>
that I can rip out if we think it might be a long term problem)<br>

a difference IOCTL number so the two can diverge if needed in the long run.=

<br>
e.g. If it makes it easier to get upstream, we can merrily duplicated code<=

so that only the bit common with RAS API etc is shared (assuming the<br>

&gt; &gt; (General purpose Linux Server Distro (Redhat, Suse etc))<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; This is equivalent of RAW command support on CXL Type 3 memory de=
vices.<br>
&gt; &gt; You can enable those in a distro kernel build despite the scary c=
onfig<br>
&gt; &gt; help text, but if you use it the kernel is tainted. The result<br=
>
&gt; &gt; of the taint is to add a flag to bug reports and print a big mess=
age to say<br>
&gt; &gt; that you&#39;ve used a feature that might result in you shooting =
yourself<br>
&gt; &gt; in the foot.<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; The taint is there because software is not at first written to de=
al with<br>
&gt; &gt; everything that can happen smoothly (e.g. surprise removal) It&#3=
9;s hard<br>
&gt; &gt; to survive some of these events, so is never on the initial featu=
re list<br>
&gt; &gt; for any bus, so this flag is just to indicate we have entered a w=
orld<br>
&gt; &gt; where almost all bets are off wrt to stability.=C2=A0 We might no=
t know what<br>
&gt; &gt; a command does so we can&#39;t assess the impact (and no one trus=
ts vendor<br>
&gt; &gt; commands to report affects right in the Command Effects Log - whi=
ch<br>
&gt; &gt; in theory tells you if a command can result problems).=C2=A0 <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; That is a secondary reason that the taint is there. Yes, it helps<br>
&gt; upstream not waste their time on bug reports from proprietary use case=
s,<br>
&gt; but the effect of that is to make &quot;raw&quot; command mode unattra=
ctive for<br>
&gt; deploying solutions at scale. It clarifies that this interface is a<br=
>
&gt; debug-tool that enterprise environment need not worry about.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; The more salient reason for the taint, speaking only for myself as a<b=
r>
&gt; Linux kernel community member not for $employer, is to encourage open<=
br>
&gt; collaboration. Take firmware-update for example that is a standard<br>
&gt; command with known side effects that is inaccessible via the ioctl()<b=
r>
&gt; path. It is placed behind an ABI that is easier to maintain and reason=
<br>
&gt; about. Everyone has the firmware update tool if they have the &#39;cat=
&#39;<br>
&gt; command. Distros appreciate the fact that they do not need ship yet<br=
>
&gt; another vendor device-update tool, vendors get free tooling and end<br=
>
&gt; users also appreciate one flow for all devices.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; As I alluded here [1], I am not against innovation outside of the<br>
&gt; specification, but it needs to be open, and it needs to plausibly beco=
me<br>
&gt; if not a de jure standard at least a de facto standard.<br>

Agree with all this.<br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; A concern was raised about GAE/FAST/LDST tables for CXL Fabrics<b=
r>
&gt; &gt; (a r3.1 feature) but, as I understand it, these are intended for =
a<br>
&gt; &gt; host to configure and should not have side effects on other hosts=
?<br>
&gt; &gt; My working assumption is that the kernel driver stack will handle=
<br>
&gt; &gt; these (once we catch up with the current feature backlog!) Curren=
tly<br>
&gt; &gt; we have no visibility of what the OS driver stack for a fabrics w=
ill<br>
&gt; &gt; actually look like - the spec is just the starting point for that=
.<br>
&gt; &gt; (patches welcome ;)<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; The various CXL upstream developers and maintainers may have<br>
&gt; &gt; differing views of course, but my current understanding is we wan=
t<br>
&gt; &gt; to support 1 and 2, but are very resistant to 3!=C2=A0 <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 1, yes, 2, need to see the patches, and agree on 3.<br>
<br>
If we end up with top architecture of the diagrams above, 2 will look prett=
y<br>
similar to last version of the switch-cci patches.=C2=A0 So raw commands on=
ly + taint.<br>
Factoring out MMPT is another layer that doesn&#39;t make that much differe=
nce in<br>
practice to this discussion. Good to have, but the reuse here would be one =
layer<br>
above that.<br>
<br>
Or we just say go for second proposed architecture and 0 impact on the<br>
CXL specific code, just reuse of the MMPT layer.=C2=A0 I&#39;d imagine peop=
le will get<br>
grumpy on code duplication (and we&#39;ll spend years rejecting patch sets =
that<br>
try to share the cdoe) but there should be no maintenance burden as<br>
a result.<br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; General Notes<br>
&gt; &gt; =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; One side aspect of why we really don&#39;t like unfiltered usersp=
ace access to any<br>
&gt; &gt; of these devices is that people start building non standard hacks=
 in and we<br>
&gt; &gt; lose the ecosystem advantages. Forcing a considered discussion + =
patches<br>
&gt; &gt; to let a particular command be supported, drives standardization.=
=C2=A0 <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Like I said above, I think this is not a side aspect. It is fundamenta=
l<br>
&gt; to the viability Linux as a project. This project only works because<b=
r>
&gt; organizations with competing goals realize they need some common<br>
&gt; infrastructure and that there is little to be gained by competing on t=
he<br>
&gt; commons.<br>

&gt; &gt; provides some history on vendor specific extensions and why in ge=
neral we<br>
&gt; &gt; won&#39;t support them upstream.=C2=A0 <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Oh, you linked my writeup... I will leave the commentary I added here =
in case<br>
&gt; restating it helps.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; To address another question raised in an earlier discussion:<br>
&gt; &gt; Putting these Fabric Management interfaces behind guard rails of =
some type<br>
&gt; &gt; (e.g. CONFIG_IM_A_BMC_AND_CAN_MAKE_A_MESS) does not encourage the=
 risk<br>
&gt; &gt; of non standard interfaces, because we will be even less likely t=
o accept<br>
&gt; &gt; those upstream!<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; If anyone needs more details on any aspect of this please ask.<br=
>
&gt; &gt; There are a lot of things involved and I&#39;ve only tried to giv=
e a fairly<br>
&gt; &gt; minimal illustration to drive the discussion. I may well have mis=
sed<br>
&gt; &gt; something crucial.=C2=A0 <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; You captured it well, and this is open source so I may have missed<br>
&gt; something crucial as well.<br>
&gt; <br>
<br>
Thanks for detailed reply!<br>
