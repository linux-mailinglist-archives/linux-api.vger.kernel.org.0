All of the above should be able to be handled by vendor-specific KERNEL
drivers that feed the needed information to the proper user/kernel apis
that the kernel already provides.

So while innovating at the hardware level is fine, follow the ways that
everyone has done this for other specification types (USB, PCI, etc.)
and just allow vendor drivers to provide the information.  Don't do this
in crazy userspace drivers which will circumvent the whole reason we
have standard kernel/user apis in the first place for these types of
things.

Then fight this out in the specification groups, which are highly
political, and do not push that into the kernel space please.  Again,
this is nothing new, we have all done this for specs for decades now,
allow vendor additions to the spec and handle that in the kernel and all
should be ok, right?

Or am I missing something obvious here where we would NOT want to do
what all other specs have done?

thanks,
