What concrete action would that high-level service be able to take
after waiting for such an event?

My model of the vmgenid mechanism is that RNGs and cryptographic
libraries that use it need to be fundamentally written such that it is
guaranteed that a VM fork can not cause the same random number /
counter / ... to be reused for two different cryptographic operations
in a way visible to an attacker. This means that e.g. TLS libraries
need to, between accepting unencrypted input and sending out encrypted
data, check whether the vmgenid changed since the connection was set
up, and if a vmgenid change occurred, kill the connection.

Can you give a concrete example of a usecase where the vmgenid
mechanism is used securely and the confirmation mechanism is necessary
as part of that?

Are you saying that, because people might not want to write proper
bindings for this interface while also being unwilling to take the
performance hit of calling read() in every place where they would have
to do so to be fully correct, you want to build a "best-effort"
mechanism that is deliberately designed to allow some cryptographic
state reuse in a limited time window?

It would be much nicer if we could have one simple interface that lets
everyone correctly do what they need to, though...
