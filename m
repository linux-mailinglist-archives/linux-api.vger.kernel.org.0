I'm pretty sure a single bit is not enough if you want to have a
single page, shared across the entire system, that stores the VM
forking state; you need a counter for that.

Microsoft's documentation
(http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=3D260709) says that the VM
Generation ID that we get after a fork "is a 128-bit,
cryptographically random integer value". If multiple people use the
same image, it guarantees that each use of the image gets its own,
fresh ID: The table in section "How to implement virtual machine
generation ID support in a virtualization platform" says that (among
other things) "Virtual machine is imported, copied, or cloned"
generates a new generation ID.

So the RNG state after mixing in the new VM Generation ID would
contain 128 bits of secret entropy not known to anyone else, including
people with access to the VM image.

Now, 128 bits of cryptographically random data aren't _optimal_; I
think something on the order of 256 bits would be nicer from a
theoretical standpoint. But in practice I think we'll be good with the
128 bits we're getting (since the number of users who fork a VM image
is probably not going to be so large that worst-case collision
probabilities matter).

As far as I can tell from Microsoft's spec, that is a guarantee we're
already getting.
