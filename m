I agree with this. Further, I'm observing there is a very common
confusion between "universally unique" and "random". Randoms are
needed when seeking unpredictability. A random number generator
*must* be able to return the same value multiple times in a row
(though this is rare), otherwise it's not random.

To illustrate this, a die has less than 3 bits of randomness and
is sufficient to play games with friends where a counter would allow
everyone to cheat. Conversely if you want to assign IDs to members
of your family you'd rather use a counter than a die for this or
you risk collisions and/or long series of retries to pick unique
IDs.

RFC4122 explains in great length how to produce guaranteed unique
IDs, and this only involves space, time and counters. There's
indeed a lazy variant that probably everyone uses nowadays,
consisting in picking random numbers, but this is not guaranteed
unique anymore.

If the UUIDs used there are real UUIDs, it could be as simple as
updating them according to their format, i.e. updating the timestamp,
and if the timestamp is already the same, just increase the seq counter.
Doing this doesn't require entropy, doesn't need to block and doesn't
needlessly leak randoms that sometimes make people feel nervous.

Just my two cents,
Willy
