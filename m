Oh don't worry, I didn't take it badly in any way. That was all totally
ok me getting the keys api wrong is not your problem. ;)

Ok, care to just send me a full patch for this?
Just paste it here and I'll pick it.

If at all then absolutely a separate patch.

Ok, I see.

First, good idea to make this work. :)
Second, I agree that this looks ugly. ;/

So here's a very likely a stupid idea. To make that clean we essentially
need kernel private information that can't be set in userspace (Btw,
look at EPOLL_URING_WAKE which is similar in that it cannot be set from
userspace. It's not the same thing ofc but it is a private bit.). Which
is the gist of your proposal in a way.

So we would have to grab a new private bit in the epoll flag space. A
subsystem (e.g., pidfd, seccomp) could use that private bit to avoid
spurious wakeups such as this. I'm sure that this would be useful to
others?

It's not something we need to do right now but my point is that this
would be more palatable if this coulde be made generally useful.

The only thing that's ugly is that we'd raise that bit in ->poll() but
maybe that's acceptable through a helper? If we'd wanted to set it from
epoll itself we'd need a new fop most likely. :/

I would never go above your head, don't worry. :)
