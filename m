Isn't that exactly what and adaptive mutex does?
Spin 'for a bit' before sleeping.

You need to disable interrupts in order to bound the time the
spinlock is held for.
If all you are doing is a dozen instructions (eg to remove an
item from s list) then you really don't want an interrupt coming in
while you have the spinlock held.
It isn't the cost of the ISR - that has to happen sometime, but that
the cpu waiting for the spinlock also take the cost of the ISR.

A network+softint ISR can run for a long time - I'm sure I've
seen a good fraction of a millisecond.
You really don't want another (or many other) cpu spinning while
that is going on.
Which (to my mind) pretty much means that you always want to
disable interrupts on a spinlock.
If the architecture makes masking ISR expensive then I've seen schemes
that let the hardware interrupt happen, then disable it and rerun later.

I think you'd need to detect that the cpu was in-kernel running an ISR.

But the multithreaded audio app I was 'fixing' basically failed
as soon as it had to sleep on one of the futex.
The real problem was ISR while the mutex was held.
So deciding to sleep because the lock owner isn't running (in user)
would already be delaying things too much.

Sounds like it was spinning for far too long at the best of times.
But analysing these sort of latencies is hard.
