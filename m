I figured it was kind of silly to special-case arch-agnostic comments for stack
grows up/down, how about the following instead ?

 * rseq critical sections defined with the RSEQ_CS_FLAG_ABORT_AT_IP flag
 * have the following behavior on abort: the stack pointer is adjusted to
 * skip over the redzone [*], and the aborted address (abort-at-ip) is pushed
 * at this stack pointer location.  The user-space abort handler needs to pop
 * the abort-at-ip address from the stack, and adjust the stack pointer to skip
 * back over the redzone.
 *
 * [*] The openrisc, powerpc64 and x86-64 architectures define a "redzone" as a
 *     stack area beyond the stack pointer which can be used by the compiler
 *     to store local variables in leaf functions.

Thanks,

Mathieu
