These are certainly good ideas to simplify this feature. My very first implementation of mshare did not have msharefs, 
was based on fd where fd could be passed to any other process using SCM_RIGHTS and required the process creating mshare 
region to stay alive for the region to exist. That certainly made life simpler in terms of implementation. Feedback from 
my customers of this feature (DB developers and people deploying DB systems) was this imposes a hard dependency on a 
server process that creates the mshare'd region and passes fd to other processes needing access to this region. This 
dependency creates a weak link in system reliability that is too risky. If the server process dies for any reason, the 
entire system becomes unavailable. They requested a more robust implementation that they can depend upon. I then went 
through the process of implementing this using shmfs since POSIX shm has those attributes. That turned out to be more 
kludgy than a clean implementation using a separate in-memory msharefs. That brought me to the RFC implementation I sent 
out.

I do agree with you that name based persistent object makes the implementation more complex (maintaining a separate mm 
not tied to a process requires quite a bit of work to keep things consistent and clean mm up properly as users of this 
shared mm terminate) but I see the reliability point of view. Does that logic resonate with you?
