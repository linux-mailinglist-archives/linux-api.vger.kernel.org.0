We at least need the algorithms to get added to our tpm.h, which really
has to be a separate patch, so I'd rather not conflate it with this
one.  I'll make sure that they're added to this patch (provided it's
upstream) at the same time they get added to our tpm.h.

The reason for a WARN is that we want it to trip a big bad error for
the developer.  It means we came across a TPM whose algorithm is
unsupported, so it really needs adding ASAP.  People take reporting
back WARN stack traces much more seriously than a stray dev_warn()
which often gets ignored.
