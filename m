OK, so copy_page_range() vs lockless_pages_from_mm(). Since I use
FOLL_PIN that should be sorted, it'll fall back the slow path and use
mmap_sem and serialize against the fork().

(Also, can I express my hate for __gup_longterm_unlocked(), that
function name is utter garbage)

However, I'm not quite sure what fork() does with pages that have a pin.
There's been a number of GUP vs fork() problems over the years, but I'm
afraid I have lost track of that and I can't quickly find anything in
the code..

Naively, a page that has async DMA activity should not be CoW'ed, or if
it is, care must be taken to ensure the original pages stays in the
original process, but I realize that's somewhat hard.

Let me dig in a bit more.
