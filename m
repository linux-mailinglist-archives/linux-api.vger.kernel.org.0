+FPGA virtualization - PCIe SRIOV

+This section describes the virtualization support on DFL based FPGA device to
+enable accessing an accelerator from applications running in a virtual machine
+(VM). This section only describes the PCIe based FPGA device with SRIOV support.

+Features supported by the particular FPGA device are exposed through Device
+Feature Lists, as illustrated below:

+FME is always accessed through the physical function (PF).
+
+Ports (and related AFUs) are accessed via PF by default, but could be exposed
+through virtual function (VF) devices via PCIe SRIOV. Each VF only contains
+1 Port and 1 AFU for isolation. Users could assign individual VFs (accelerators)
+created via PCIe SRIOV interface, to virtual machines.
+
+The driver organization in virtualization case is illustrated below:

+FPGA PCIe device driver is always loaded first once a FPGA PCIe PF or VF device
+is detected. It:
+
+* Finishes enumeration on both FPGA PCIe PF and VF device using common
+  interfaces from DFL framework.
+* Supports SRIOV.
+
+The FME device driver plays a management role in this driver architecture, it
+provides ioctls to release Port from PF and assign Port to PF. After release
+a port from PF, then it's safe to expose this port through a VF via PCIe SRIOV
+sysfs interface.
+
+To enable accessing an accelerator from applications running in a VM, the
+respective AFU's port needs to be assigned to a VF using the following steps:
+
+#. The PF owns all AFU ports by default. Any port that needs to be
+   reassigned to a VF must first be released through the
+   DFL_FPGA_FME_PORT_RELEASE ioctl on the FME device.
+
+#. Once N ports are released from PF, then user can use command below
+   to enable SRIOV and VFs. Each VF owns only one Port with AFU.
+
+   ::
+
+      echo N > $PCI_DEVICE_PATH/sriov_numvfs
+
+#. Pass through the VFs to VMs
+
+#. The AFU under VF is accessible from applications in VM (using the
+   same driver inside the VF).
+
+Note that an FME can't be assigned to a VF, thus PR and other management
+functions are only available via the PF.
