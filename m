Only those with CAP_SYS_MODULE.
Having this capability would also allow them load the module normally when
mounted in or potentially downloaded from the internet.

This is what we are currently doing. But sometimes this gets forgotten at some
point in the chain of nested containers/namespaces and things break.

They are special insofar as they always have to match the running kernel.
Which is managed by the root namespace.

The biggest problems would probably arise if the root namespace has non-standard
modules available which the container would normally not have access to.

I think this is a big potential problem and which would not be justified by the
quality of life improvement.

Sorry for the noise.
