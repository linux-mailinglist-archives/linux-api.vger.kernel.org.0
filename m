The overwhelming majority of the PCIe switches get deployed in a single
server. Typically four to eight switches are connected to two or more root
complexes in one or two CPUs. The deployment scenario you have in mind -
multiple physical hosts running general workloads and a management-only
host - exists. But it is insignificant.

Thank you. As you do this, please keep in mind that your concern about not
affecting "other" hosts is theoretically valid but doesn't exist in the
real world beyond science experiments. If there are real-world deployments,
they are insignificant. I urge you all to make your stuff work with 99.99%
of the deployments.

Your proposal sounds reasonable. I will let you all experts figure out how
to support the vendor-defined commands. CXL spec has them for a reason and
they need to be supported.

&gt; Thank you for kicking off this discussion, Jonathan.<br>
<br>
Hi Sreenivas,<br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; We need guidance from the community.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 1. Datacenter customers must be able to manage PCIe switches in-band.<=
br>
<br>
What is the use case? My understanding so far is that clouds and<br>
similar sometimes use an in band path but it would be from a management<br>
only host, not a general purpose host running other software. Sure<br>
that control host just connects to a different upstream port so, from<br>
a switch point of view, it&#39;s the same as any other host.=C2=A0 From a h=
ost<br>
software point of view it&#39;s not running general cloud workloads or<br>
(at least in most cases) a general purpose OS distribution.<br>
<br>
This is the key question behind this discussion.<br>
<br>
&gt; 2. Management of switches includes getting health, performance, and er=
ror<br>
&gt; telemetry.<br>
<br>
For telemetry(subject to any odd corners like commands that might lock<br>
the interface up for a long time, which we&#39;ve seen with commands in the=
<br>
Spec!) I don&#39;t see any problem supporting those on all host software.<b=
r>
They should be non destructive to other hosts etc.<br>
<br>
&gt; 3. These telemetry functions are not yet part of the CXL standard<br>
<br>
Ok, so this we should try to pin down the boundaries around this.<br>
The thread linked below lays out the reasoning behind a general rule<br>
of not accepting vendor defined commands, but perhaps there are routes<br>
to answer some of those concerns.<br>
<br>
&#39;Maybe&#39; if you were to publish a specification for those particular=
<br>
vendor defined commands, it might be fine to add them to the allow list<br>
for the switch-cci. Key here is that Broadcom would be committing to not<br=
>
using those particular opcodes from the vendor space for anything else<br>
in the future (so we could match on VID + opcode).=C2=A0 This is similar to=
<br>
some DVSEC usage in PCIe (and why DVSEC is different from VSEC).<br>
<br>
Effectively you&#39;d be publishing an additional specification building on=
 CXL.<br>
Those are expected to surface anyway from various standards orgs - should<b=
r>
we treat a company published one differently?=C2=A0 I don&#39;t see why.<br=
>
Exactly how this would work might take some figuring out (in main code,<br>
separate driver module etc?)<br>
<br>
That specification would be expected to provide a similar level of detail<b=
r>
to CXL spec defined commands (ideally the less vague ones, but meh, up to<b=
r>
you as long as any side effects are clearly documented!)<br>
<br>
Speaking for myself, I&#39;d consider this approach.<br>
Particularly true if I see clear effort in the standards org to push<br>
these into future specifications as that shows broadcom are trying to<br>
enhance the ecosystems.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; 4. We built the CCI mailboxes into our PCIe switches per CXL spec and<=
br>
&gt; developed our management scheme around them.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; If the Linux community does not allow a CXL spec-compliant switch to b=
e<br>
&gt; managed via the CXL spec-defined CCI mailbox, then please guide us on<=
br>
&gt; the right approach. Please tell us how you propose we manage our switc=
hes<br>
&gt; in-band.<br>
<br>
The Linux community is fine supporting this in the kernel (the BMC or<br>
Fabric Management only host case - option 2 below, so the code will be ther=
e)<br>
the question here is what advice we offer to the general purpose<br>
distributions and what protections we need to put in place to mitigate the<=
br>
&#39;blast radius&#39; concerns.<br>
<br>
Jonathan<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Thank you<br>

&gt; &gt; Hi All,<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; This is has come up in a number of discussions both on list and i=
n private,<br>
&gt; &gt; so I wanted to lay out a potential set of rules when deciding whe=
ther or<br>
&gt; &gt; not<br>
&gt; &gt; to provide a user space interface for a particular feature of CXL=
 Fabric<br>
&gt; &gt; Management.=C2=A0 The intent is to drive discussion, not to simpl=
y tell people<br>
&gt; &gt; a set of rules.=C2=A0 I&#39;ve brought this to the public lists a=
s it&#39;s a Linux<br>
&gt; &gt; kernel<br>
&gt; &gt; policy discussion, not a standards one.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Whilst I&#39;m writing the RFC this my attempt to summarize a pos=
sible<br>
&gt; &gt; position rather than necessarily being my personal view.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; It&#39;s a straw man - shoot at it!<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Not everyone in this discussion is familiar with relevant kernel =
or CXL<br>
&gt; &gt; concepts<br>
&gt; &gt; so I&#39;ve provided more info than I normally would.<br>

&gt; &gt; CXL has two different types of Fabric. The comments here refer to=
 both, but<br>
&gt; &gt; for now the kernel stack is focused on the simpler VCS fabric, no=

&gt; &gt; recent Port Based Routing (PBR) Fabrics. A typical example for 2 =
hosts<br>
&gt; &gt; connected to a common switch looks something like:<br>

&gt; &gt; Some typical fabric management activities:<br>
&gt; &gt; 1) Bind/Unbind vPPB to physical DSP (Results in hotplug / unplug =
events)<br>
&gt; &gt; 2) Access config space or BAR space of End Points below the switc=
h.<br>
&gt; &gt; 3) Tunneling messages through to devices downstream (e.g Dynamic =
Capacity<br>
&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 Forced Remove that will blow away some memory even i=
f a host is using<br>
&gt; &gt; it).<br>
&gt; &gt; 4) Non destructive stuff like status read back.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Given the hosts may be using the Type 3 hosted memory (either Sin=
gle<br>
&gt; &gt; Logical<br>
&gt; &gt; Device - SLD, or an LD on a Multi logical Device - MLD) as normal=
 memory,<br>
&gt; &gt; unbinding a device in use can result in the memory access from a<=
br>
&gt; &gt; different host being removed. The &#39;blast radius&#39; is perha=
ps a rack of<br>
&gt; &gt; servers.=C2=A0 This discussion applies equally to FM-API commands=
 sent to Multi<br>
&gt; &gt; Head Devices (see CXL r3.1).<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; The Fabric Management actions are done using the CXL spec defined=
 Fabric<br>
&gt; &gt; Management API, (FM-API) which is transported over various means =
including<br>
&gt; &gt; OoB MCTP over your favourite transport (I2C, PCIe-VDM...) or via =
normal<br>
&gt; &gt; PCIe read/write to a Switch-CCI.=C2=A0 A Switch-CCI is mailbox in=
 PCI BAR<br>
&gt; &gt; space on a function found alongside one of the switch upstream po=
rts;<br>
&gt; &gt; this mailbox is very similar to the MMPT definition found in PCIe=
 r6.2.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; In many cases this switch CCI / MCTP connection is used by a BMC =
rather<br>
&gt; &gt; than a normal host, but there have been some questions raised abo=
ut whether<br>
&gt; &gt; a general purpose server OS would have a valid reason to use this=
 interface<br>
&gt; &gt; (beyond debug and testing) to configure the switch or an MHD.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; If people have a use case for this, please reply to this thread t=
o give<br>
&gt; &gt; more details.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; The most recently posted CXL Switch-CCI support only provided the=
 RAW CXL<br>
&gt; &gt; command IOCTL interface that is already available for Type 3 memo=
ry<br>
&gt; &gt; devices.<br>
&gt; &gt; That allows for unfettered control of the switch but, because it =
is<br>
&gt; &gt; extremely easy to shoot yourself in the foot and cause unsolvable=
 bug<br>
&gt; &gt; reports,<br>
&gt; &gt; it taints the kernel. There have been several requests to provide=
 this<br>
&gt; &gt; interface<br>
&gt; &gt; without the taint for these switch configuration mailboxes.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Last posted series:<br>

&gt; &gt; Note there are unrelated reasons why that code hasn&#39;t been up=
dated since<br>
&gt; &gt; v6.6 time,<br>
&gt; &gt; but I am planning to get back to it shortly.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Similar issues will occur for other uses of PCIe MMPT (new mailbo=
x in PCI<br>
&gt; &gt; that<br>
&gt; &gt; sometimes is used for similarly destructive activity such as PLDM=
 based<br>
&gt; &gt; firmware update).<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; On to the proposed rules:<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; 1) Kernel space use of the various mailboxes, or filtered control=
s from<br>
&gt; &gt; user space.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Absolutely fine - no one worries about this, but the mediated tra=
ffic will<br>
&gt; &gt; be filtered for potentially destructive side effects. E.g. it wil=
l reject<br>
&gt; &gt; attempts to change anything routing related if the kernel either =
knows a<br>
&gt; &gt; host is<br>
&gt; &gt; using memory that will be blown away, or has no way to know (so a=
ffecting<br>
&gt; &gt; routing to another host).=C2=A0 This includes blocking &#39;all&#=
39; vendor defined<br>
&gt; &gt; messages as we have no idea what the do.=C2=A0 Note this means th=
e kernel has<br>
&gt; &gt; an allow list and new commands are not initially allowed.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; This isn&#39;t currently enabled for Switch CCIs because they are=
 only really<br>
&gt; &gt; interesting if the potentially destructive stuff is available (an=
 earlier<br>
&gt; &gt; version did enable query commands, but it wasn&#39;t particularly=
 useful to<br>
&gt; &gt; know what your switch could do but not be allowed to do any of it=
).<br>
&gt; &gt; If you take a MMPT usecase of PLDM firmware update, the filtering=
 would<br>
&gt; &gt; check that the device was in a state where a firmware update won&=
#39;t rip<br>
&gt; &gt; memory out from under a host, which would be messy if that host i=
s<br>
&gt; &gt; doing the update.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; 2) Unfiltered userspace use of mailbox for Fabric Management - BM=
C kernels<br>
&gt; &gt; =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

=3D=3D=3D<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; (This would just be a kernel option that we&#39;d advise normal s=
erver<br>
&gt; &gt; distributions not to turn on. Would be enabled by openBMC etc)<br=
>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; This is fine - there is some work to do, but the switch-cci PCI d=
river<br>
&gt; &gt; will hopefully be ready for upstream merge soon. There is no filt=
ering of<br>
&gt; &gt; accesses. Think of this as similar to all the damage you can do v=
ia<br>
&gt; &gt; MCTP from a BMC. Similarly it is likely that much of the complexi=
ty<br>
&gt; &gt; of the actual commands will be left to user space tooling:<br>
&gt; &gt; <a href=3D"https://gitlab.com/jic23/cxl-fmapi-tests" rel=3D"noref=
errer" target=3D"_blank">https://gitlab.com/jic23/cxl-fmapi-tests</a> has s=
ome test examples.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Whether Kconfig help text is strong enough to ensure this only ge=
ts<br>
&gt; &gt; enabled for BMC targeted distros is an open question we can addre=
ss<br>
&gt; &gt; alongside an updated patch set.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; (On to the one that the &quot;debate&quot; is about)<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; 3) Unfiltered user space use of mailbox for Fabric Management - D=
istro<br>
&gt; &gt; kernels<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D<br>
&gt; &gt; (General purpose Linux Server Distro (Redhat, Suse etc))<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; This is equivalent of RAW command support on CXL Type 3 memory de=
vices.<br>
&gt; &gt; You can enable those in a distro kernel build despite the scary c=
onfig<br>
&gt; &gt; help text, but if you use it the kernel is tainted. The result<br=
>
&gt; &gt; of the taint is to add a flag to bug reports and print a big mess=
age to say<br>
&gt; &gt; that you&#39;ve used a feature that might result in you shooting =
yourself<br>
&gt; &gt; in the foot.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; The taint is there because software is not at first written to de=
al with<br>
&gt; &gt; everything that can happen smoothly (e.g. surprise removal) It&#3=
9;s hard<br>
&gt; &gt; to survive some of these events, so is never on the initial featu=
re list<br>
&gt; &gt; for any bus, so this flag is just to indicate we have entered a w=
orld<br>
&gt; &gt; where almost all bets are off wrt to stability.=C2=A0 We might no=
t know what<br>
&gt; &gt; a command does so we can&#39;t assess the impact (and no one trus=
ts vendor<br>
&gt; &gt; commands to report affects right in the Command Effects Log - whi=
ch<br>
&gt; &gt; in theory tells you if a command can result problems).<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; A concern was raised about GAE/FAST/LDST tables for CXL Fabrics<b=
r>
&gt; &gt; (a r3.1 feature) but, as I understand it, these are intended for =
a<br>
&gt; &gt; host to configure and should not have side effects on other hosts=
?<br>
&gt; &gt; My working assumption is that the kernel driver stack will handle=
<br>
&gt; &gt; these (once we catch up with the current feature backlog!) Curren=
tly<br>
&gt; &gt; we have no visibility of what the OS driver stack for a fabrics w=
ill<br>
&gt; &gt; actually look like - the spec is just the starting point for that=
.<br>
&gt; &gt; (patches welcome ;)<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; The various CXL upstream developers and maintainers may have<br>
&gt; &gt; differing views of course, but my current understanding is we wan=
t<br>
&gt; &gt; to support 1 and 2, but are very resistant to 3!<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>

&gt; &gt; =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; One side aspect of why we really don&#39;t like unfiltered usersp=
ace access to<br>
&gt; &gt; any<br>
&gt; &gt; of these devices is that people start building non standard hacks=
 in and we<br>
&gt; &gt; lose the ecosystem advantages. Forcing a considered discussion + =
patches<br>
&gt; &gt; to let a particular command be supported, drives standardization.=

&gt; &gt; provides some history on vendor specific extensions and why in ge=
neral we<br>
&gt; &gt; won&#39;t support them upstream.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; To address another question raised in an earlier discussion:<br>
&gt; &gt; Putting these Fabric Management interfaces behind guard rails of =
some type<br>
&gt; &gt; (e.g. CONFIG_IM_A_BMC_AND_CAN_MAKE_A_MESS) does not encourage the=
 risk<br>
&gt; &gt; of non standard interfaces, because we will be even less likely t=
o accept<br>
&gt; &gt; those upstream!<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; If anyone needs more details on any aspect of this please ask.<br=
>
&gt; &gt; There are a lot of things involved and I&#39;ve only tried to giv=
e a fairly<br>
&gt; &gt; minimal illustration to drive the discussion. I may well have mis=
sed<br>
&gt; &gt; something crucial.<br>
