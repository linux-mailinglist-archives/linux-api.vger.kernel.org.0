I know I am replying to a stale thread on the patches I've submit (there is
a v5 now [1]), but I just looked at your message - sorry I didn't reply
sooner.

The per-queue and per-napi netlink APIs look extremely useful, thanks for
pointing this out.

In my development tree, I had added SIOCGIFNAME_BY_NAPI_ID which works
similar to SIOCGIFNAME: it takes a NAPI ID and returns the IF name. This is
useful on machines with multiple NICs where each NIC could be located in
one of many different NUMA zones.

The idea was that apps would use SO_INCOMING_NAPI_ID, distribute the NAPI
ID to a worker thread which could then use SIOCGIFNAME_BY_NAPI_ID to
compute which NIC the connection came in on. The app would then (via
configuration) know where to pin that worker thread; ideally somewhere NUMA
local to the NIC.

I had assumed that such a change would be rejected, but I figured I'd send
an RFC for it after the per epoll context stuff was done and see if anyone
thought SIOCGIFNAME_BY_NAPI_ID would be useful for them, as well.

I agree.

I had been contemplating implementing this until I tried a different method
similar to an academic paper I was reading [2][3]. I think per-device
defer_hard_irqs and gro_flush_timeout would be extremely useful and a
better approach than the one I'm currently using.

Is this something you are currently working? I may try implementing this,
but didn't want to duplicate effort if you are already working on this.

Thanks,
Joe
