Ah, okay.

Correct; I've been thinking in analogues of the way we schedule CPUs.
Each CPU has a ready/run queue along with the current task.
fundamentally the RUNNABLE tasks need to go somewhere when all servers
are busy. So at that point the previous server is as good a place as
any.

Now, I sympathise with a blocked task not having a relation; I often
argue this same, since we have wakeup balancing etc. And I've not really
thought about how to best do wakeup-balancing, also see below.

Right; it does that. It can check the ::state of it's current task,
possibly set TF_PREEMPT or just go back to sleep.

I suppose it's easy enough to make this behaviour configurable though;
simply enqueue and not wake.... Hmm.. how would this worker know if the
server was 'busy' or not? The whole 'current' thing is a user-space
construct. I suppose that's what your pointer was for? Puts an actual
idle server in there, if there is one. Let me ponder that a bit.

However, do note this whole scheme fundamentally has some of that, the
moment the syscall unblocks until sys_exit is 'unmanaged' runtime for
all tasks, they can consume however much time the syscall needs there.

Also, timeout on sys_umcg_wait() gets you the exact same situation (or
worse, multiple running workers).

OOh yes, I forgot to mention that. I couldn't figure out what it was
supposed to do.

I've not yet come across a case where this is needed. Migration for
instance is possible when RUNNABLE, simply write ::server_tid before
::state. Userspace just needs to make sure who actually owns the task,
but it can do that outside of this state.

But like I said; I've not yet done the userspace part (and I lost most
of today trying to install a new machine), so perhaps I'll run into it
soon enough.
