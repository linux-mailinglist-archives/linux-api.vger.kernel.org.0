Thanks for looking at this.

Mapping root uid 0(GLOBAL_ROOT_UID) from init namespace into a user 
namespace is allowed right now. so the proposal was to extend this to 
allow capabilities like CAP_SYS_NICE to take effect which is lacking.

Understand encouraging use of GLOBAL_ROOT_UID for this purpose may not 
be a good idea.

We could look at other means to grant such capabilities to user 
namespace thru a per process /proc file like 'cap_map' or something as 
suggested in the other thread. What do you think about this approach?

Only privileged user in init namespace gets to add an entry to this 
file. We need to define if this gets inherited by any nested user 
namespaces that get created.

No not in other containers. Only on processes with in the container 
which as this capability. The use case is to use it in a container with 
user namespace and pid namespace. So no processes from other containers 
should be visible. Necessary checks should be added?.

Yes that is the intended use.

Ok

But this is what seems to be lacking. A container could have some 
critical processes running which need to run at a higher priority.

Giving privileges to only to those user with root uid from init 
namespace inside the user namespace(GLOBAL_ROOT_UID), or if not using 
GLOBAL_ROOT_UID, then privilege granted thru the /proc mechanism as 
mentioned above.

If the effect of allowing such privileges inside user namespace could be 
controlled with use of Cgroups, even then would it be a concern?
