So I don't object to having this blocking list, we had that early on in
the discussions.

*However*, combined with WF_CURRENT_CPU this 1:N userspace model doesn't
really make sense, also combined with Proxy-Exec (if we ever get that
sorted) it will fundamentally not work.

More consideration is needed I think...
