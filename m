Yep, sorry, we only recently noticed that this was broken.  I fixed
this very recently (over the holidays) in clang-14, and is too risky
and late to backport to clang-13 IMO.

=3D constraints should work with older clang releases; + constraints are
what was broken (Not generally, only when using asm goto with
outputs), fixed in clang-14.

^ That case should not work in either compilers, more info below...

"Bumping the param number" will be required when using numbered
references, more info below...

Right, so in fixing the above issue with tied outputs, I noticed that
the GCC implementation of asm goto with outputs had different
behavior. I changed clang's implementation in clang-14 (same patch
series) to match:
https://reviews.llvm.org/rG5c562f62a4ee15592f5d764d0710553a4b07a6f2
This comment summarizes most of my thoughts on the issue:
https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3D98096#c7
Specifically the quote "It appears to me that the GCC decision here
was accidental, and that when pointed out, the bug was simply
documented rather than fixed."
Though I think compatibility between compilers is ultimately more
important.  There's no standards bodies involved in these extension,
which is simultaneously more flexible, yet can also lead to
differences in implementations like this. Thanks for attending my TED
talk.

Right; I assumed we'd hit this at some point, as soon as people wanted
to used tied outputs with asm goto.  I'd rather have a different
Kconfig test for working tied outputs, and that all uses in the
kernels used the symbolic references which are much more readable and
less confusing than the rules for numbered references (which are bug
prone IMO).
