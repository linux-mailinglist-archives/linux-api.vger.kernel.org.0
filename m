If someone wants to do it, great, but I do not have the
confidence to do it myself so I hope you will forgive me for
taking a pass here.

Another alternative I considered was to only call
checksyscalls.sh when doing a 'make all'. This way, we keep the
warning but people wonâ€™t be spammed when building sub projects
because the script would not be executed.

I tried to be as less disruptive as possible. Unless people show
interest in one of the alternative approaches, I will keep using
the -Wno-unused-macros approach in the v2.

Just realized that I added a new line for no reason.
This will be removed in v2. Sorry.
