Sure, thanks for pointing this out.

I am happy to cap the budget to 64 if a user app requests a larger amount
and I can add a netdev_warn when this happens, if you'd like.

The 'why' has two reasons:
  - Increasing the budget for fast NICs can help improve throughput
    under load (i.e. the hardcoded amount might be too low for some users)
  - other poll methods have user-configurable budget amounts
    (SO_BUSY_POLL_BUDGET), so epoll stands out as an edge case where the
    budget is hardcoded.

I hope that reasoning is sufficient and I can include that more explicitly
in the commit message.

FWIW: My reading of SO_BUSY_POLL_BUDGET suggests that any budget amount
up to U16_MAX will be accepted. I probably missed it somewhere, but I
didn't see a warning in this case.

I think in a v2 SO_BUSY_POLL_BUDGET and the epoll ioctl budget should
be capped at the same amount for consistency and I am happy to agree to 64
or 128 or similar as a cap.

Let me know what you think and thanks again for your thoughts and detailed
response.

Thanks for sending this link, I'll need to take a closer look, but a quick
read surfaced two things:

  Their use is very limited, since they enforce busy polling
  for all sockets, which is not desirable

We agree on the limited usefulness of system-wide settings ;)

  Another big problem is that Busy Polling was not really
  deployed in production, because it works well when having
  no more than one thread per NIC RX queue.

I've been testing epoll-based busy poll in production with a few different
NICs and application setups and it has been pretty helpful, but I agree
that this is application architecture specific as you allude to in
your next paragraph about the scheduler.

Thanks for linking to the paper.

It would be great if all of this context and information could be put in
one place in the kernel docs. If I have time in the future, I'll propose a
doc change to try to outline all of this.

Thanks for letting me know. I think I'd seen these in passing, but hadn't
remembered until you mentioned it now.

Ah, I see. FWIW, I have so far only been trying to use it for TCP and so
far I haven't hit any bugs.

I was planning to use it with UDP in the future, though, once the TCP
epoll-based busy polling stuff I am working on is done... so thanks in
advance for the bug fixes in UDP.

Sorry about that. I am happy to make modifications to my patches if there's
anything I could do which would make your work easier in the future.

Thanks,
Joe
