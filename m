Agreed. I was just trying to outline that the removal of the blocking_pool =
is=20
a good thing. Even when we decide that random.c should receive a TRNG, we d=
o=20
not need to re-add a blocking pool, but can easily use the existing ChaCha2=
0=20
DRNG (most likely with its own instance).

But such scenario will always occur, will it not? If there are two callers =
for=20
a limited resource, they will content if one "over-uses" the resource. My i=
dea=20
was to provide an interface where its use does not starve other more releva=
nt=20
use cases (e.g. seeding of the DRNGs). I.e. a user of a TRNG has the right =
to=20
be DoSed - that is the price to pay when using this concept.

I am under the impression that the over-using of /dev/random is that other =
use=20
cases like re-seeding of /dev/urandom are DoSed. But if there is a hog on t=
he=20
TRNG that only causes a problem for itself for other equally specialized=20
applications, so be it.

When using a char device with rights of 440, then at least all applications=
=20
part of that special group will still content for TRNG data. The only=20
additional benefit I would currently see for a char device with permissions=
 of=20
440 is that an admin can control which applications have access to the TRNG=
 to=20
begin with. But when an attacker can fool those applications to use more=20
random data, we again have a DoS. So, we just pushed the issue down the roa=
d=20
without solving it (and I think there is no solution for the issue that TRN=
G=20
users can DoS each other).=20

Speaking of GnuPG and after having some discussions with Werner Koch, I thi=
nk=20
the reason for using /dev/random was that this (used to be) the only=20
randomness source that has a guarantee of being seeded (Werner is not=20
participating in this thread, so I hope I am not misrepresenting his words)=
=2E=20
With the presence of getrandom(2), this is now solved. IIRC libgcrypt has=20
received support for getrandom(2) and the issue of blocking on /dev/random=
=20
should now be a thing of the past with recent libgcrypt (and thus GnuPG)=20
versions.=20

Ciao
Stephan
