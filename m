yes, some optimization implemented in a specific integrated-only version
of hardware, this patch is used to support that particular hardware. This
is also the reason you see code here to check hardware revision in this
patch.

Yes, you are right, in previous version, it doesn't have avx512 enable check
there, so it's possible to have false reporting, it should be fine after
driver does early check on this during probe. As this patch has been dropped
from main patchset, may rework it later and resubmit. Thanks for the comments.
