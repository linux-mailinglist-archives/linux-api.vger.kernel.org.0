Well, what do you suggest: macros that generate macros can't use
brackets around the arguments because the macro generation becomes
wrong.  This is the thing that checkpatch is insisting on because the
usual fault people commit in macros that generate C code is forgetting
that unless you bracket the arguments in the macro they can have
unintended side effects.
