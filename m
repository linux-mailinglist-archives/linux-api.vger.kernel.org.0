That being said, there might be an architecture agnostic alternative available.
On abort of a RSEQ_CS_FLAG_ABORT_AT_IP critical section, we could let the kernel
decrement/increment the stack pointer to make room for a pointer (depending if the
stack grows down or up). It would then store the abort-at-ip value at the top of
stack.

The abort handler would be expected to use this top of stack abort-at-ip value,
and would be required to increment/decrement (depending on the stack direction)
the stack pointer back to its rightful value before the end of the assembly block.

Thoughts ?
