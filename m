Ok, I rebased on top of Paul's 'lsm: drop LSM_ID_IMA', made IMA and EVM
as standalone LSMs, and assigned LSM IDs to them in the correct
chronological order.

Still left DEFINE_LSM(integrity) to reserve space for the
integrity_iint_cache pointer, but it does not register any LSM hook,
then no LSM ID required.

In the future, we might be able to make IMA and EVM use disjoint
metadata, so they will reserve space in the security blob and register
appropriate hooks for the metadata management.

With this intermediate solution, I can keep the rbtree patch, which
will provide performance improvements due to searching metadata in
constant time.

If you want to have a look before I send the patch set, the code is
available here:

https://github.com/robertosassu/linux/commits/ima-evm-lsms-v4-devel-v7

It passes all IMA tests:
