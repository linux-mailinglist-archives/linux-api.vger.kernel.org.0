A quick question here, is there any reason why we don't have cpu_online_mask
instead of cpu_possible_mask in the housekeeping_cpumask()?
(not for this particular patch but in general)

Thanks for the detailed explanation.

Before I posted this patch, I was doing some debugging on a setup where I
was observing some latency issues due to the iavf IRQs that were pinned on
the isolated CPUs.

Based on some initial traces I had this impression that the affinity hint
or cpumask_local_spread was somehow playing a role in deciding the affinity
mask of these IRQs. Although, that does look incorrect after going through
your explanation.
For some reason, with a kernel that had this patch when I tried creating
VFs iavf IRQs always ended up on the HK CPUs.

The reasoning for the above is still not very clear to me. I will investigate
this further to properly understand this behavior.
