Yes, but all the eligible VMAs still have to be traversed after all. It may
induce more latency than needed because the target task has to be
stopped to avoid races.

What's the meaning of the prctl extension?
I don't quite get your point. Can prctl control external process?

Not like THP, KSM doesn't have anything like VM_NOHUGEPAGE, so apps
cann't explicitly disallow merging by madvise. If it is really necessary for
a particular meory ranges of a process to be never merged, we have to submit
one more patch to achieve that.
