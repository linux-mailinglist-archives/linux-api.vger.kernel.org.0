There is no existing format for TPM 2.0 ... that's part of the problem
since we certainly didn't want to carry over the TPM 1.2 format.

I've got to say I think binary attributes are actively evil.  I can see
they're a necessity when there's no good way to represent the data they
contain, like the bios measurement log or firmware code or a raw
interface like we do for the SMP frame code in libsas.  But when
there's a well understood and easy to produce user friendly non-binary
representation, I think dumping binary is inimical to being a good API.

There's no current use case today that wants all values.  Every current
use case wants either a single PCR or a selection mostly from a single
bank, so forcing every current user to dig out the values they want 
from a binary blob rather than being able to gather them simply also
seems to be an API that makes users' lives harder than they need to be.
