At least for x86, the faulting ip is already in ucontext, and si_addr is 
mostly the memory address being accessed if that was the reason of the 
fault (i.e. the memory is not supposed to be accessed).  That way, the 
signal handler has both the instruction pointer and the memory address.

For shadow stack violation, for example, it is not because the memory 
being accessed; it is the instruction itself causing the violation.  It 
is unnecessary to duplicate the ip in si_addr.  Setting si_addr to zero 
also indicates this is not a memory type fault.
