You could think of it that way, yes.

I don't think that would be acceptable to the sysfs folks, as they only allow
one value per file.  I suppose a bitmask could be viewed as unacceptable too,
but it seemed to make sense here, given that the data unit sizes are always
powers of 2, and the hardware reports them as bitmasks.

Greg already reviewed this patch, but maybe he wasn't looking at this part.

Greg, any opinion on the best way to report a set of power-of-2 values via
sysfs?

kobj_attribute isn't strongly-typed to the specific type of kobject.  It also
includes a store function pointer, which is not necessary here.

What I'm doing here is very common; take a look at some other code that
implements sysfs attributes.  Even block/blk-sysfs.c.

I want to make it so that all crypto modes show up in sysfs without having to
write extra code every time a new crypto mode is added.  That's not possible if
the attributes are defined statically.  Defining them in the same array would
come close, since then it would be hard for people to forgot to update one place
and not the other.  But that would mix together the sysfs support and the core
blk-crypto support, which seems undesirable.
