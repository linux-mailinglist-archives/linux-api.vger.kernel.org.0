This scares me. The DRNG should be simple and easy to understand. If we=E2=80=
=99re tapping extra numbers in some weird way, then I would be more comforta=
ble with some clear assurance that this doesn=E2=80=99t break the security. I=
f we=E2=80=99re tapping numbers in the same way as normal urandom, then I do=
n=E2=80=99t really see the point.

This doesn=E2=80=99t solve the problem. If two different users run stupid pr=
ograms like gnupg, they will starve each other.

As I see it, there are two major problems with /dev/random right now: it=E2=80=
=99s prone to DoS (i.e. starvation, malicious or otherwise), and, because no=
 privilege is required, it=E2=80=99s prone to misuse. Gnupg is misuse, full s=
top. If we add a new unprivileged interface, gnupg and similar programs will=
 use it, and we lose all over again.
