No multi-line outputs in sysfs please.  If you have to do a "selection
from an array", that is not how to do it.

Look at the output of /sys/power/pm_test/ as one way you can do it if
you have to choose one option from a list:
$ cat /sys/power/pm_test
[none] core processors platform devices freezer

But I don't think that applies here, right?

A single hex value makes sense to me.
