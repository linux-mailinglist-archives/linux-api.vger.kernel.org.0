This might indeed fit nicely as an extension of my KTLS prototype (extensible rseq):

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20200925181518.4141-1-mathieu.desnoyers@efficios.com/

There are a few ways we could wire things up. One might be to add the
UUID field into the extended KTLS structure (so it's always updated after it
changes on next return to user-space). For this I assume that the Linux scheduler
within the guest VM always preempts all threads before a VM is suspended (is that
indeed true ?).

This leads to one important question though: how is the UUID check vs commit operation
made atomic with respect to suspend ? Unless we use rseq critical sections in assembly,
where the kernel will abort the rseq critical section on preemption, I don't see how we
can ensure that the UUID value does not change right after it has been checked, before
the "commit" side-effect. And what is the expected "commit" side-effect ? Is it a store
to a variable in user-space memory, or is it issuing a system call which sends a packet over
the network ?

Thanks,

Mathieu
