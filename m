Are you trying to avoid spinning when the owning process is sleeping?
Or trying to avoid the system call when it will find that the futex
is no longer held?

The latter is really horribly detremental.

IIRC 'page table separation' which is what makes system calls expensive
is only a compile-time option. So is likely to be enabled on any 'distro'
kernel.
But a lot of other mitigations (eg RSB stuffing) are also pretty detrimental.

OTOH if you have a 'hot' userspace mutex you are going to lose whatever.
All that needs to happen is for a ethernet interrupt to decide to discard
completed transmits and refill the rx ring, and then for the softint code
to free a load of stuff deferred by rcu while you've grabbed the mutex
and no matter how short the user-space code path the mutex won't be
released for absolutely ages.

I had to change a load of code to use arrays and atomic increments
to avoid delays acquiring mutex.
