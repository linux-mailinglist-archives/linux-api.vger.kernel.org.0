But it's not some arbitrary time to spin. Technically, a kernel spin lock
is spinning on the heuristic of ownership. "Spin until the lock is
released" is a heuristic!

That's just noise of normal processing. What's the difference of it
happening during spinning to where it happens in normal execution?

As supposed to just going into the kernel? So it wastes some of its quota.
It's not stopping anything else from running more than normal.

Why not? The current user space only code does that now (and it will even
spin if the owner is preempted). What we are talking about implementing is
a big improvement to what is currently done.

The benchmarks say otherwise. Sure, once in a while you may spin longer
because of an interrupt, but that's a very rare occurrence compared to
normal taking of spin locks. Disabling interrupts is an expensive
operation. The savings you get from "not waiting for a softirq to finish"
will be drowned out by the added overhead of disabling interrupts at every
acquire.

For the few times that might happen, it's not worth it.

That doesn't sound like the use case we are fixing. If your audio app
failed because it had to sleep, that tells me it would fail regardless.

It wasn't spinning at all! The problem was that all rt_mutex would
immediately sleep on any contention. This caused a ripple effect that would
increase the time locks were held and that would increase contention which
increased the time more. A very bad feedback loop.

This was all very well traced and studied. That analysis was not hard at
all. We know exactly what the cause was and why adaptive mutexes fixed the
situation. And this is why I'm excited about this current work.
