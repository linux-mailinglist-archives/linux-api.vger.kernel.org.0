Absolutely.. although a stack might work, except for that ABA issue (and
contention).

Typically yes, one server task per hardware thread. Now, I'm also fairly
sure you don't want excessive cross-node traffic for this stuff, so that
puts a limit on things as well.

Right, a tid array might work. Could even have userspace specify the
length, then it can do the trade-offs all on it's own. Either a fixed
location for each server and a larger array, or clever things, whatever
they want.

I suppose I'll code up the variable length array, we have space for
that.
