What is this GRND_EXPLICIT thing?

A few weeks ago, I sent a whole series to address this, and I
obviously didn't cc enough people.  I'll resend a rebased version
today.  Meanwhile, some comments on this whole mess:

As I think everyone mostly agrees in this whole thread, getrandom()
can't just magically start returning non-random results.  That would
be a big problem.

Linus, I disagree that blocking while waiting for randomness is an
error.  Sometimes you want to generate a key, you want to finish as
quickly as possible, and you don't want to be in the business of
fiddling with the setup of the kernel RNG.  I would argue that *most*
crypto applications are in this category.  I think that the kernel
should, instead, handle this mess itself.  As a first pass, it could
be as simple as noticing that someone is blocking on randomness and
kicking off a thread that does some randomish reads to the rootfs.
This would roughly simulate the old behavior in which an ext4 rootfs
did more IO than necessary.  A fancier version would, as discussed in
this thread, do more clever things.

(As an aside, I am not a fan of xoring or adding stuff to the CRNG
state.  We should just use an actual crypto primitive for this.
Accumulate the state in a buffer and SHA-512 it.  Or use something
like the Keccak duplex sponge.  But this is a discussion for another
day.)

So I'm going to resend my series.  You can all fight over whether the
patch that actually goes in should be based on my series or based on
this patch.
