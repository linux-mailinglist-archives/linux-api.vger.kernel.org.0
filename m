If PIDFD_THREAD then I think it is enough. Otherwise we still need
!task || (exit_state && thread_group_empty)

The patch adds the new xxx_exited(task, excl) helper which checks

	!task || (exit_state && (excl || thread_group_empty))

yes, the naming is not good.

Again, I mostly tried to argue with do_notify_pidfd() called by realese_task().

I think that with PIDFD_THREAD set pidfd_poll() should succeed right
after the exiting thread becomes a zombie (passes exit_notify), whether
it is a leader or not.

Let me quote part of my reply to Tycho's patch

	This doesn't look consistent.

	If the task is a group leader do_notify_pidfd() is called by exit_notify()
	when it becomes a zombie (if no other threads), before it is reaped by its
	parent (unless autoreap).

	If it is a sub-thread, it is called by release_task() above. Note that a
	sub-thread can become a zombie too if it is traced.

Not to mention that this is racy.

I would not mind if we simply move do_notify_pidfd() from exit_notify() to
release_task() and do it regardless of thread_group_leader(). And in some
sense this looks more logical to me.

But as I said:

	- I do not know how/why people actually use poll(pidfd)

	- it is too late to change the current behaviour

Sorry for confusion.

All I can recall is that, yes, we had some discussions about pidfd in
the past ;)

Agreed,

Oleg.
