Extensible structs are targeted at system calls that are either known to
grow a lot of features or we already have prior versions that have
accumulated quite a lot of features or that by their nature need to be
more complex.
openat2() is not really complex per se (At least not yet. It will likely
grow quite a bit in the future...). The kernel now has infrastructure
since clone3() and later generalized with openat2() and is well-equipped
with a consistent api to deal with such syscalls so I don't see how this
is really an issue in the first place. Yes, syscalls should be kept
as simple as possible but we don't need to lock us into a "structs as
arguments" are inherently bad mindset. That will also cause us to end up
with crappy syscalls that are awkward to use for userspace.
(Second-level pointers is a whole different issue of course.)

(Arnd, you should also note that we're giving a talk at kernel summit
about new syscall conventions and I'm syncing with Florian who'll be
talking about the userspace side and requirements of this.)
