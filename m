Already fixed pagefaults per:

I still have no clear answer as to what you actually want there.

Not in kernel, if they need to be migrated, userspace needs to do that.

I still absolutely hate how long you do page pinning, it *will* wreck
things like CMA which are somewhat latency critical for silly things
like Android camera apps and who knows what else.

You've also forgotten about this:

  YcWutpu7BDeG+dQ2@hirez.programming.kicks-ass.net

That's not optional given how you're using page-pinning. Also, I think
we need at least one direct access to the page after getting the pin in
order to make it work.

That also very much limits it to Anon pages.
