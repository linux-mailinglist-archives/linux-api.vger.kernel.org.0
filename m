It should be, but I thought that Greg had complained about people doing that
before, and required strictly one value per file.  So we would need his opinion.

Note that a bitmask isn't hard to handle in a shell script:

	mask=$(</sys/block/sda/queue/crypto/modes/AES-256-XTS)
	if (( mask & 4096 )); then
		echo "4096-byte data units supported"
	fi

But I could see how someone could prefer something like

	if grep -q '\<4096\>' /sys/block/sda/queue/crypto/modes/AES-256-XTS; then
		echo "4096-byte data units supported"
	fi
