I don=E2=80=99t buy it. We have existing programs that can deadlock on boot.=
 Just throwing -EAGAIN at them in a syscall that didn=E2=80=99t previously b=
lock does not strike me as reasonable.

The problem is that we don=E2=80=99t know what userspace is doing with the o=
utput from getrandom(..., 0), so I think we have to be conservative. New ker=
nels need to work with old user code. It=E2=80=99s okay if they=E2=80=99re s=
lower to boot than they could be.

The point is that we keep the timer running by looping like this, which shou=
ld cause add_timer_randomness() to get called continuously, which should pre=
vent the deadlock.  I assume the deadlock is because we go into nohz-idle an=
d we sit there with nothing happening at all.

What I mean is: allow user code to register a usermode helper that helps get=
 entropy. Or just convince distros to bundle some useful daemon that starts a=
t early boot and lives in the initramfs.
