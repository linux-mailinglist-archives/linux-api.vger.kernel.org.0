Surely it will, we don't currently have any IOMMU fault handling or
forwarding of IOMMU faults through to the vfio bus driver, both of
those would be included in an IOASID implementation.  I think Jason's
vision is to use IOASID to deprecate type1 for all use cases, so even
if we were to choose to implement IOPF in type1 we should agree on
common interfaces with IOASID.

You're essentially enabling this for a vfio bus driver via patch 7/8,
pinning for selective DMA faulting.  How would a driver in userspace
make equivalent requests?  In the case of performance, the user could
mlock the page but they have no mechanism here to pre-fault it.  Should
they?

Yes, there's of course going to be overhead in terms of latency for the
page faults.  My point was more that when a host is not under memory
pressure we should trend towards the performance of pinned, static
mappings and we should be able to create arbitrarily large pre-fault
behavior to show that.  But I think what we really want to enable via
IOPF is density, right?  Therefore how many more assigned device guests
can you run on a host with IOPF?  How does the slope, plateau, and
inflection point of their aggregate throughput compare to static
pinning?  VM startup time is probably also a useful metric, ie. trading
device latency for startup latency.  Thanks,

Alex
