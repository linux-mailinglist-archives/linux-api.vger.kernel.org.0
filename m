So any given futex_wake(FUTEX_NUMA) operates only within its node, right?

In this example, T1, T2 and T3 are all blocking on node 2 (since all of
them presumably specify hint == 2), right? In this sense, it doesn't
matter which node they are running on, what matters is what node they
block on.

What I'm asking is can I wake all threads blocked on all nodes on the
same futex? That is, is the following possible?

  // I'm using hint == -1 to indicate the current node
  // of the calling thread for waiters and all nodes for notifiers
  struct futex32_numa f = {.value = 0, .hint = -1};

  Thread 1, running on node 3, blocks on node 3:

  futex_wait(&f, 0, FUTEX_NUMA | FUTEX_32, NULL);

  Thread 2, running on node 0, blocks on node 0:

  futex_wait(&f, 0, FUTEX_NUMA | FUTEX_32, NULL);

  Thread 3, running on node 2, blocks on node 2:

  futex_wait(&f, 0, FUTEX_NUMA | FUTEX_32, NULL);

  And then, Thread 4, running on whatever node:

  futex_wake(&f, -1, FUTEX_NUMA | FUTEX_32);

Here, futex_wake would wake T1, T2 and T3. Or:

  futex_wake(&f, 1, FUTEX_NUMA | FUTEX_32);

Here, futex_wake would wake any one of T1, T2 or T3.

I'm not sure yet. If there isn't a cross-node behavior like in my
example above then, I suppose, it falls to the userspace to ensure fair
rotation of the wakeups on different nodes. If there is functionality
like this, I imagine, some sort of fairness would be desired.
