Dear Friend,

I'm sorry but happy to inform you about my success in getting those
funds transferred under the cooperation of a new partner from Vietnam,
though I tried my best to involve you in the business but God decided
the whole situations. Presently I m in Vietnam for investment projects
with my own share of the total sum. Meanwhile, I didn't forget your
past efforts and attempts to assist me in transferring those funds
despite that it failed us some how.

Now contact my secretary in Burkina Faso her name is Ms. Milla Smith
on her e-mail address below   millasmith2111@gmail.com  ask her to
send you the total of $1.1Milion which I kept for your compensation
for all the past efforts and attempts to assist me in this matter. I
appreciated your efforts at that time very much. So feel free and get
in touched with my secretary Ms. Milla Smith and instruct her where to
send the amount to you. Please do let me know immediately you receive
it so that we can share joy after all the sufferness at that time.

In the moment, I=E2=80=99m very busy here because of the investment project=
s
which I and the new partner are having at hand, finally, remember that
I had forwarded instruction to the secretary on your behalf to receive
that money, so feel free to get in touch with Ms. Milla Smith she will
send the amount to you without any delay OK. Extend my greetings to
your family.

My Best regards
Yours brother
Mr. Abu Salam
Greetings from Vietnam
