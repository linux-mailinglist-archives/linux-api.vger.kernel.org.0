Just a gentle reminder to everyone that if you are replying to a large
patch and only commenting on a couple of things in the patch, please
trim your reply so it is easier for others to read; we've got good
archives these days, if someone needs the extra context they can look
it up.

I think the origin is probably due to the fact that early drafts
allowed multiple attributes to be set, but as we've discussed that is
not something we want to support in the final version.  It's also
possible it was there to offer some level of symmetry with the
associated getter function, which definitely does need a dedicated
@size parameter.

I agree it isn't probably isn't strictly necessary given the current
implementation, but I somewhat like the symmetry argument and it does
give us one extra "future use" knob to fiddle with if we need it in
the future.  It's also trivial to set for callers so I don't think
having it imposes any type of real penalty on callers.

If anyone is strongly opposed to this, I suppose we can drop it.

I like having the syscalls in a separate file from the LSM hooks.  Not
only are they conceptually different, but the hooks file is pushing
~5.5k lines and is already a bit unwieldy.

... and yes, the syscalls do end up calling LSM hooks, but syscalls
are an *external* API with respect to the kernel while the hooks are
an *internal* API with respect to the kernel.

?

I seeing a put_user() call in security_getselfattr() that should
update @size; am I missing something here?

Good point.  I believe it also works to set @size.

I believe this is so that the caller can get a @size value too, to
help guide allocations for a future call.

Agreed, in fact I have a vague memory that is how this works, but it
has been a few weeks since I seriously looked at this code.

Yes, we want to allow for that possibility.

At the very least I believe that SELinux updates the size value when
returning -E2BIG.

Thank you for the review, I appreciate it and I'm sure Casey does as
well, but I want this syscall to allow for multiple attributes.  I
think you're suggestion of adding support for LSM_FLAG_SINGLE was a
good addition, but I don't want LSM_FLAG_SINGLE to be the only option
here.

I really like the idea of a single struct that we can use across the
different LSM syscalls.

Agreed.  I thought I mentioned something like that at one point, maybe
not.  In general we should do whatever user/kernel copying and sanity
checking in the LSM layer that we can; there will be somethings we
can't check, but those that we can, we should.
